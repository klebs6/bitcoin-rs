# Bitcoin Blob Crate

`bitcoin-blob` is a Rust library for handling fixed-size, opaque byte arrays, or _blobs_, commonly used in Bitcoin-related applications. This crate provides utility macros to define and manipulate these base blobs with specified sizes.

## Features

- **Blob Definition:** Provides a macro to define blobs of arbitrary bit and byte size.
- **Iteration:** Supports iteration over bytes within a blob by value, reference, or mutation.
- **Serialization:** Offers serialization and deserialization methods for the blob structures.
- **Hexadecimal Conversion:** Convert blobs to and from hexadecimal strings, following common cryptography conventions.
- **Comparison Operations:** Implements comparison, ordering, and equality checks for blobs.
- **Random Generation:** Includes a simple pseudo-random number generator for testing and utilities.

## Technical Overview

This library leverages macros extensively to generate efficient and maintainable code for manipulating fixed-size byte arrays. It defines and implements several common traits and methods across different bit-width arrays, ensuring type safety and correctness.

### Example

```rust
// Define a new base blob of 64-bits (8 bytes)
base_blob!(BaseBlob64, 64, 8);

// Initialize and manipulate the blob
let mut blob = BaseBlob64::default();
blob.set_hex_from_str("0xdeadbeef");
let hex_representation = blob.get_hex();
println!("Hex: {}", hex_representation);  // Outputs: Hex: efbeadde00000000
```

## Usage

Add the `bitcoin-blob` crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-blob = "0.1.19"
```
