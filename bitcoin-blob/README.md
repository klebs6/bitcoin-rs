# bitcoin-blob

`bitcoin-blob` is a highly specialized Rust library designed to handle fixed-size, opaque byte arrays known as blobs. It provides extensive functionality for iterating, serializing, deserializing, hex encoding/decoding, and more.

## Features

- **Flexible Blob Definitions:** Define blobs of arbitrary bit/byte sizes using powerful macros.
- **Iterators:** Seamlessly iterate over blob data in mutable and immutable forms.
- **Serialization:** Robust functionality to serialize blobs to and from streams.
- **Hex Utilities:** Convert blobs to hexadecimal strings and vice versa.
- **Typical Operations:** Includes utility methods for checking if blobs are null, comparing blobs, and basic byte-level manipulations.
- **Deterministic RNG:** Includes a simple RNG for deterministic testing purposes.

## Usage

Below is an example of how to define and use a 256-bit blob:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate bitcoin_blob;

base_blob!(BaseBlob256, 256, 32);

fn main() {
    let mut blob = BaseBlob256::zero();
    blob.set_hex_from_str("abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890");
    println!("Hex: {}", blob.to_string());
}
```
