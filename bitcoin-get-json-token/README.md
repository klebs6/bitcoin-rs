# bitcoin-get-json-token

`bitcoin-get-json-token` is a Rust crate providing a robust and efficient JSON tokenization functionality particularly focused on Bitcoin-related applications. This crate leverages various utilities to lex and parse JSON structures, making it ideal for situations requiring JSON data handling within the cryptocurrency domain. 

## Features
- Efficient parsing of JSON tokens including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and JSON-specific keywords (`null`, `true`, `false`).
- Functions like `json_isspace` and `json_isdigit` help in identifying JSON-compliant whitespace and digit characters.
- Provides conversion from hexadecimal strings to unsigned integers through `hatoui`.
- Thoroughly detailed instrumentation with tracing capabilities to debug or explore the JSON tokenization process.

## Technical Details
The crate defines an enumeration `JTokenType`, which represents various JSON entities such as object openings `{`, closures `}`, array openings `[`, closures `]`, key-value separators `:`, etc. Lexical analysis is performed by recognizing these structural symbols and keywords through functions like `lex_structural`, `lex_keyword`, `lex_number`, and `lex_string`. Each function is crafted to ensure precision and correctness of JSON parsing.

## Usage
This crate is suited for developers working on JSON parsing in applications where JSON data is prevalent, especially within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Detailed tracing also aids in the precise debugging of complex JSON structures to facilitate rigorous data validation requirements.
