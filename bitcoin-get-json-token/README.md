# bitcoin-get-json-token

The `bitcoin-get-json-token` crate is designed for efficient parsing and tokenizing of JSON data within the context of Bitcoin-related applications. It provides precise control over JSON token recognition and categorization through a meticulous enumeration process. The primary functionality includes identification of JSON structural elements, keywords, numbers, and string literals—all critical for the seamless processing of JSON data structures.

## Features
- **Efficient JSON Whitespace Identification**: The library provides functionality to recognize JSON-specified whitespace characters, aiding in accurate data parsing.
- **Syntactic JSON Number Verification**: Offers a utility to verify if a string is a syntactically correct JSON number.
- **Hexadecimal Conversion**: Includes tools for converting hexadecimal strings into unsigned integers, vital for low-level data manipulations.
- **Comprehensive Tokenization Support**: Through functions like `get_json_token`, it supports the recognition and parsing of JSON tokens, facilitating fine-grained JSON data examination.

## Technical Details
- **Enum Representation**: JSON tokens are represented through the `JTokenType` enumeration, distinguishing between various JSON components such as objects, arrays, and numeric and string literals.
- **RFC Standards**: Adheres to RFC 7159 specifications for JSON data interchange, ensuring compliance with accepted data formats.

## Usage
To include `bitcoin-get-json-token` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-get-json-token = "0.1.1"
```

## Example
Here is a simple usage example demonstrating JSON number verification:
```rust
use bitcoin_get_json_token::valid_num_str;

let number_str = "123.45";
assert!(valid_num_str(number_str));
```
