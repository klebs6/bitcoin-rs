# bitcoin-base58

`bitcoin-base58` is a Rust crate offering efficient and reliable base58 encoding and decoding functionalities. It implements the base58 encoding, widely used in Bitcoin, including variations with and without checksum, enabling its integration into applications that handle cryptocurrency data formats.

## Features

- **Base58 Encoding**: Convert byte arrays into base58 strings without leading zeroes, minimizing storage while preserving data integrity.
- **Base58Check Encoding**: Incorporate a checksum (double SHA-256) to ensure reliability of the encoded data, with automatic embedding and extraction during encode/decode operations.
- **Decoding with Validation**: Robust decoding function that verifies validity, including whitespace checks and character validation, adhering strictly to the base58 alphabet.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-base58 = "0.1.20"
```

Example usage of the crate:

```rust
use bitcoin_base58::{encode_base58, decode_base58};

let data: &[u8] = &[0x00, 0x14, 0x0f, 0x1b];
let encoded = encode_base58(data);
println!("Encoded: {}", encoded);

let mut decoded = Vec::new();
if decode_base58(&encoded, &mut decoded, 100) {
    println!("Decoded: {:?}", decoded);
} else {
    println!("Failed to decode base58 string.");
}
```
