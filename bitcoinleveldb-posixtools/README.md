# bitcoinleveldb-posixtools

`bitcoinleveldb-posixtools` is a Rust library providing POSIX-focused tools for managing environment resources, locks, and configurations, aligned with bitcoin-leveldb bindings. It is specifically designed to ensure efficient and safe concurrent operations in environments leveraging POSIX standards.

## Functionality Overview

- **Environment Management**: Provides tools to manage environmental variables and configurations in a single-instance manner using `SingletonEnv` which ensures controlled initialization.

- **File Locking**: Provides structures and functionalities such as `PosixLockTable` and `PosixFileLock` for managing file locks. These are crucial for system processes that require exclusive access to resources within POSIX environments.

- **Limit Management**: Manages the limits of memory maps and open files through atomic operations ensuring safe concurrent access and modifications.

## Advanced Concepts

### Synchronization Primitives
This crate extensively uses Rust's concurrency primitives such as `std::sync::Mutex` and atomic types (e.g., `AtomicI32`) for thread-safe operations.

### Environment Configurations
Implements POSIX-like configurations, providing flexibility for setting file descriptor limits and memory maps, utilizing system calls such as `fcntl` and `getrlimit` with fallback strategies.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoinleveldb-posixtools = "0.1.1"
```

## Usage
Refer to the Rust documentation for detailed examples and API references.
