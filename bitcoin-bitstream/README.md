# Bitcoin Bitstream

`bitcoin-bitstream` is a Rust crate designed for efficient handling of bitwise streams, primarily in the context of Bitcoin serialization and deserialization. This crate provides utilities to manipulate data streams at the bit level, supporting both big-endian and little-endian operations which are essential in numerous financial and blockchain applications.

## Features

- **Bitstream Handling**: Provides `BitStreamReader` and `BitStreamWriter` structs for reading from and writing to bit-oriented streams, allowing precise control over individual bits.
- **Stream Serialization**: Offers `DataStream` handling that allows seamless serialization and deserialization, mimicking typical C++ stream behavior.
- **Endian-Aware Functions**: Implements functions like `writebe16`, `writele64`, `readbe32`, and `readle64` for endianness-specific operations crucial for network programming and data interchange.
- **OverrideStream Abstraction**: Facilitates customized stream processing via traits like `Backend`, `StreamItems`, and `StreamInto`.
- **Traceable Operations**: Extensive use of Rust's `tracing` capabilities to monitor function calls, aiding in debugging and performance analysis.

## Usage

Add `bitcoin-bitstream` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-bitstream = "0.1.19"
```

Use the crate in your Rust project:

```rust
use bitcoin_bitstream::{BitStreamReader, BitStreamWriter};

fn main() {
    // Example usage of BitStreamReader
    let reader = BitStreamReader::new(/*...*/);
    let bits = reader.read(8);
    println!("Read bits: {}", bits);

    // Example usage of BitStreamWriter
    let mut writer = BitStreamWriter::new(/*...*/);
    writer.write(10, 8);
    writer.flush();
}
```

## Structures

### `OverrideStream`
Defines stream operations, leveraging internal pointers for in-place reading and writing.

### `BitStreamReader` and `BitStreamWriter`
Facilitate reading and writing streams bit-by-bit, crucial for custom protocol implementations.

### `DataStream`
Encapsulates a data buffer with read and write capabilities, often used in serialization.
