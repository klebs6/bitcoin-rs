# Bitcoin Service Crate

The `bitcoin-service` crate provides network service functionalities that are foundational for developing custom Bitcoin networking applications. Specifically, this crate offers tools for handling network addresses and ports, which are essential for establishing and managing peer-to-peer connections in a Bitcoin network.

## Functionality

The key structures and traits in this crate include:

- **Service**: Represents a combination of a network address (`CNetAddr`) and a TCP port. It provides methods to construct services from IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, obtain socket addresses, and convert the service instance into a descriptive string format.

- **ServiceHash**: Provides a custom hashing mechanism using SIP hashing tailored for `Service` instances. This ensures rapid and reliable identification and storage of service entities.

- **GetServiceRef & GetServiceMut Traits**: These traits allow for immutable and mutable access to the `Service` structure, promoting encapsulation and modularity.

## Important Concepts
This crate leverages advanced Rust features including:

- **Serde Serialization/Deserialization**: The `Service` struct is serialized and deserialized seamlessly helping with efficient data exchange.

- **Lazy Static Initialization**: Used for initialization of static variables in a thread-safe manner.

- **Conversion Traits**: Implements conversions from `sockaddr_in` and `sockaddr_in6` to the `Service` type.

## Usage

### Example

```rust
use bitcoin_service::{Service, GetServiceRef};

fn main() {
    let service = Service::new_from_ip4(&some_ipv4, 8333);
    println!("Service Address and Port: {}", service.to_string_ip_port());
}
```

This crate is useful for developers focusing on Bitcoin application with needs for customized networking functionalities.
