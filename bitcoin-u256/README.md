# bitcoin-u256

`bitcoin-u256` is a robust and efficient Rust crate designed for handling 256-bit unsigned integers, commonly used in Bitcoin computations. This crate provides a comprehensive API that supports various operations, conversions, and abstractions essential for cryptographic and blockchain contexts.

## Features

- **256-bit Opaque Blob**: Defined as `u256`, this structure enables storage and manipulation of 256-bit integers efficiently, with methods to seamlessly convert between different formats.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implements basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division under the `ArithU256` structure. It wraps low-level operations to maintain precision and uphold performance.

- **Compact Representation**: Supports compact format conversions, essential for representing whole numbers in a format akin to floating point, which is used in Bitcoin for encoding difficulty targets.

- **Endian-safe Conversions**: Compatible with Bitcoin's endian representation requirements through functions that correctly convert and interpret byte orders.

- **Hash and Serialization**: Implements standard Rust traits for hashing, comparison, serialization, and deserialization, ensuring seamless integration with other Rust ecosystem tools and libraries.

- **Checkpoints Handling**: Offers a way to manage checkpoints by associating block heights with `u256`, critical for maintaining synchronization points in blockchain progression.

## Usage

```rust
use bitcoin_u256::{u256, ArithU256};

fn main() {
    // Initialize a zeroed `u256`
    let default_u256 = u256::default();
    println!("Default u256: {}", default_u256);

    // Example: Hashing and comparison of `u256`
    let another_u256 = u256::from_bytes_32([0u8; 32]);
    assert_eq!(default_u256, another_u256);

    // Arithmetic operations using `ArithU256`
    let mut value = ArithU256::from(42);
    value += 10;
    println!("ArithU256 value: {}", value);
}
```
