# bitcoin-u256

The `bitcoin-u256` crate provides an efficient representation and manipulation of 256-bit unsigned integers specifically tailored for Bitcoin and similar blockchain applications. It leverages both low-level bitwise operations and high-level arithmetic functionalities to offer a comprehensive suite for dealing with 256-bit numbers often encountered in cryptographic contexts.

## Overview
The core structure `u256` is implemented as an opaque `BaseBlob256`, which means no direct arithmetic operations are possible by default, keeping a pure bit-blob interface for scenario specifics such as hash IDs. For arithmetic operations, `ArithU256` is provided, enabling bitwise operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all within the confines of a 256-bit environment.

## Features
- **Conversion between `u256` and `ArithU256`**: Functions allow easy conversions between the two representations, accommodating the need for cryptographic hash functions and arithmetic computation.
- **Compact Format Handling**: Efficient conversion to and from Bitcoin's compact format for difficulty representation.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Comprehensive bitwise operations like NOT, XOR, AND, and OR, crucial for cryptographic operations.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports standard arithmetic operations, ensuring accurate calculations needed during block validation and other consensus critical paths.
- **Serialization and Deserialization**: Compatibility with serialization frameworks to facilitate network communication and storage.

## Usage
This crate benefits those implementing cryptocurrency protocols, especially when handling cryptographically significant numbers such as hash targets or difficulty representation.

```rust
use bitcoin_u256::{ArithU256, u256};

// Creating a u256 from an array
let num = u256::from_bytes_32([0u8; 32]);

// Converting to ArithU256 for arithmetic
let ar_num = ArithU256::from(&num);
// Perform arithmetic
let sum = ar_num.clone() + ArithU256::from(10u64);

// Serialize the result
let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&num).unwrap();
println!("Serialized u256: {}", serialized);
```
