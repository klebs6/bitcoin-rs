## bitcoinleveldb-util

`bitcoinleveldb-util` is a Rust crate designed for advanced memory management, specifically aimed at scenarios where objects' destructors should never be invoked. This crate is particularly suitable for use cases where traditional destructor semantics must be circumvented, typical in low-level systems programming or when interfacing with hardware or legacy systems known from C++ paradigms.

### Features

- **DoNotDestruct Struct**: A struct that ensures its destructor is never executed, mimicking the behavior of `std::abort()` in C++ when its destructor is forcibly invoked.
  - Allows precise control over object lifecycle, providing fail-safe mechanisms.
  
- **NoDestructor Struct**: Facilitates storage of instances whose destructors should not be executed, leveraging `MaybeUninit` to suppress auto drop behavior.
  - Suitable for static-like memory allocations where destructor calls are undesired.

### Usage

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_util::{DoNotDestruct, NoDestructor};

let object = DoNotDestruct::new(42, 64);
let no_destruct = NoDestructor::new(object);

let ptr = no_destruct.get(); // Use with caution, ensuring manual memory management.
```

### Technical Insights

This crate draws inspiration from C++ techniques such as aligned storage and placement-new, adapting these concepts into Rust's syntactical and safety paradigms. Specifically, `NoDestructor` makes use of Rust's `MaybeUninit` to prevent the automatic invocation of destructors, while `DoNotDestruct` leverages logging and immediate process abort to ensure the fallibility of uncontrolled release is mitigated.

### Safety Statement

While this crate provides powerful low-level memory management capabilities, it is crucial that consumers exercise caution, especially around pointer arithmetic and manual memory handling, to maintain system integrity and prevent undefined behavior.
