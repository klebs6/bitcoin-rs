# bitcoin-support

Bitcoin-Support is a Rust crate designed for robust cryptographic operations tailored toward supporting secure Bitcoin-related functionalities. This library focuses on secure memory allocation and management with a strong emphasis on system-level detail and precision.

## Features
- **Platform Independent Sockets:** Provides alias types for socket descriptors enabling cross-platform compatibility.
- **Secure Memory Management:** Features a custom `SecureAllocator` for `SecureString` and `SerializeData`, ensuring memory locked buffers and cleansed deallocation.
- **Callback Infrastructure:** Keeps compatibility with libevent's C ABI through designated callback types such as `EventCallback` and `EvHttpRequestCallback`.
- **Dynamic Event Handling:** Offers tools like `EventBase`, `LibEvent`, and `EvHttpConnection` with automated lifecycles and unique identification.
- **Path Uniqueness:** Guarantees unique path creation using high-resolution time data and address entropy.

## Usage
This crate is intended for developers requiring secure and efficient Bitcoin protocol operations integrated with event-driven architectures. It benefits from using secure, stateless allocators and traceable logging at system-level interactions.

## Mathematical and Cryptographic Details
Leveraging atomic operations and system-level synchronization, bitcoin-support optimizes secure deletion and memory lock-in criteria, vital for cryptographic privacy.

## Getting Started
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-support = "0.1.19"
```
