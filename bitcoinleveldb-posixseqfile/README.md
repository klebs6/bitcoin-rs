# bitcoinleveldb-posixseqfile

`bitcoinleveldb-posixseqfile` is a Rust crate providing POSIX compliant sequential file read operations for LevelDB implementations. It aims to fulfill the need for efficient file operations by implementing a `SequentialFile` abstraction using POSIX system calls. The crate ensures to keep operations minimalistic and focused on file access using the `read` and `skip` capabilities.

## Features

- **Sequential Read Access**: Utilizing POSIX `read()` ensures streamlined access based on the sequence of data without thread safety but offering thread-friendly instances.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of system errors ensures that the user can handle I/O anomalies effectively.
- **Low-level System Integration**: Interfaces directly with low-level libc functions like `lseek` and `read` to perform operations.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: File descriptors are managed using Rust's ownership model and are closed upon object drop.

## Crate Structure

The `PosixSequentialFile` struct manages file descriptors and filenames to perform sequential read operations. It implements the `SequentialFile`, `SequentialFileSkip`, and `SequentialFileRead` traits to provide file operations:

- `new`: Constructs a new `PosixSequentialFile` with a filename and file descriptor.
- `read`: Reads a specified number of bytes from a file into a buffer.
- `skip`: Enables skipping of a specified number of bytes using `lseek`.
- `drop`: Closes the file descriptor when the struct is dropped, ensuring resource cleanup.

## Usage

Create a `PosixSequentialFile` instance by providing a filename and a file descriptor:

```rust
let file = PosixSequentialFile::new("file.txt".to_string(), fd);
```

Perform read and skip operations with:

```rust
let status = file.read(n, &mut result, &mut scratch);
let status = file.skip(n);
```
