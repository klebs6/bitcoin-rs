# bitcoinleveldb-versionedit

The `bitcoinleveldb-versionedit` crate provides utilities for manipulating version edits within the context of a LevelDB-inspired storage engine in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Through sophisticated encoding and decoding strategies, this crate enables precise operations such as adding, deleting, and compacting files across different storage levels.

## Overview

`VersionEdit` is the principal structure in this crate, encapsulating state changes that need to be applied to a version of a database. The design ensures that modifications such as file addition and deletion are implemented with utmost efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Encoding and Decoding**: The utility functions within enable consistent and deterministic serialization/deserialization of database metadata, ensuring integrity and consistency of the stored data.
- **File Operations**: The crate provides comprehensive features to manage storage files at different levels, including adding new files with specific metadata or marking existing ones for deletion.
- **Internal Representations**: The use of internal types, such as `InternalKey` and `FileMetaData`, to accurately represent the smallest and largest keys within a file, thereby optimizing query results.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking during the encoding/decoding processes minimizes the risk of corruption, and provides informative debug outputs for easier tracking.

## Usage

Below is an example of how one might use `VersionEdit` to manage file storage changes:

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_versionedit::VersionEdit;

fn main() {
    let mut ve = VersionEdit::default();
    ve.set_log_number(100);
    ve.add_file(0, 12345, 67890, &smallest_key, &largest_key);
    ve.encode_to(&mut destination_string);
    println!("{}", ve.debug_string());
}
```

## Conclusion

This crate serves as a robust tool for developers working within the Bitcoin storage space; with its advanced encoding techniques and systematic file management capabilities, `bitcoinleveldb-versionedit` is an essential component for any high-performance and reliable Bitcoin storage solution.
