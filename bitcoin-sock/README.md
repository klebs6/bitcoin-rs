# bitcoin-sock

The `bitcoin-sock` crate provides a sophisticated abstraction for handling network sockets with advanced networking features, suitable for high-performance environments where reliability and fault tolerance are paramount. This crate is particularly useful for applications resembling Blockchain nodes in Rust, where efficient message sending and receiving over sockets is essential.

## Features

- **Socket Management**: Provides traits and structures to manage sockets efficiently, including automatic cleanup and resource management.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Offers cross-platform support with tailored implementations for Windows and Unix-like operating systems.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Incorporates robust error messaging and handling features, utilizing platform-specific error codes.
- **Timeout and Interrupt Support**: Implements handling for time-limited operations and interruptions, managing network operations with precision timing.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for minimal latency and maximum throughput, supporting features like MSG_PEEK for reduced recopying.

## Usage

To use `bitcoin-sock`, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-sock = "0.1.19"
```

Here's an example of how `bitcoin-sock` might be employed within a Rust program:

```rust
use bitcoin_sock::{Sock, SockInterface};

fn main() {
    let socket = Sock::from(0);
    if socket.is_connected(&mut String::new()) {
        // Perform socket operations
    }
}
```

## API Overview

- **`SockInterface`**: Core trait for general socket interactions.
- **`SockSend` & `SockRecv`**: For transmitting and receiving data streams.
- **`SockConnect`**: Establish connections using socket addresses.
- **`SockGetSockOpt`**: Retrieve socket options and parameters.
- **`SockWait` and Event Management**: Handle readiness and events for socket operations.
- **Concurrency and Asynchronous Support**: Manage inter-thread operations with planned interrupts.
