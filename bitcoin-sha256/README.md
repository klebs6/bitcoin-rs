# bitcoin-sha256

The `bitcoin-sha256` Rust crate provides an efficient and high-performance implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm, tailored specifically for use in Bitcoin-related computations. The crate is designed to offer both flexibility and precision, allowing for the computation of SHA-256 hashes and double SHA-256 (SHA-256d) on multiple data formats. It features mechanisms for automatic backend detection to use the most suitable transformations available on the current hardware, especially benefiting from optimizations like AVX2 and SHANI on x86_64 architectures.

### Features

- **Efficient Transformations**: Utilizes various optimized transformations for SHA-256 and SHA-256d computations.
- **Backend Auto-detection**: Automatically detects and configures the most efficient backend on the host machine.
- **Flexible API**: Provides a highly programmable interface with pointer-based, trait-based, and iterator-based data input methods.
- **FFI Compatible**: Offers functions designed for compatibility with foreign function interfaces, replicating behaviors of classical C implementations.

#### Example Usage

```rust
use bitcoin_sha256::{Sha256, ComputeSha256};

let data = b"some data to hash";
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
hasher.write(data);
let mut result = [0u8; 32];
hasher.finalize(&mut result);
assert_eq!(result.len(), 32);
println!("SHA-256 hash: {:?}", result);
```

### Safety and Performance

The crate uses unsafe Rust for performance-critical operations and manual memory management, and as such, the API follows strict safety contracts as required by the SHA-256 specification.
