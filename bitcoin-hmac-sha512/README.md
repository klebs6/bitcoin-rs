# bitcoin-hmac-sha512

## Overview

The `bitcoin-hmac-sha512` crate provides a high-performance and secure implementation of the HMAC-SHA-512 hash function. Designed for integration with Bitcoin-related cryptographic operations, it enables robust message authentication with a focus on security and efficiency. By leveraging the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) construction with SHA-512, this crate ensures data integrity and authenticity.

## Features
  
- **Efficient Initialization**: Initialize the hasher with a key up to 128 bytes, with optional auto-padding for longer keys using a SHA-512 digest.
- **Data Processing**: Streamline data handling with the `write` method for continuous input.
- **Finalization**: Produce secure hashes with the `finalize` method, outputting a fixed-size authentication code.

## Usage

```rust
use bitcoin_hmac_sha512::HmacSha512;

fn main() {
    let key = b"supersecretkey";
    let mut hasher = HmacSha512::new(key.as_ptr(), key.len());
    hasher.write(b"Important transaction data.", 27);
    let mut hash_output = [0u8; 64];
    hasher.finalize(&mut hash_output);
    println!("HMAC-SHA-512: {:?}", hash_output);
}
```

In this example, a new `HmacSha512` instance is initialized using a secret key. Data is subsequently processed and finalized, yielding the desired HMAC output.

## Technical Details

The HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) construction provides a robust template for generating cryptographic checksums with secret keys, utilizing the cryptographic properties of the SHA-512 hash function. The method involves two rounds of hashing for enhanced security:

1. **Inner Hashing**: Data is hashed with a derived inner key (`rkey ^ 0x36`)
2. **Outer Hashing**: The result is hashed again with a derived outer key (`rkey ^ 0x5c`)

The implementation ensures resistance to length-extension attacks and other common cryptographic vulnerabilities.
