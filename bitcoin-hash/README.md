# bitcoin-hash

`bitcoin-hash` is a Rust crate providing a comprehensive suite of cryptographic hash functions tailored to meet the specialized needs of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in general. It implements various hash algorithms including SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, often used in cryptographic proof systems and transaction processing.

## Features
- **Bitcoin-Specific Hashers**: Offers a variety of hashers such as `Hash256` and `Hash160`, performing 256-bit and 160-bit hashes respectively, mirroring Bitcoin's use of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160.
- **SipHash Variants**: Implements different salted and non-salted versions of SipHash for secure hashmap operations, e.g., `SaltedOutpointHasher` and `SaltedTxidHasher`.
- **Tagged Hashing**: Provides a facility for BIP-340 style tagged hash calculations, ensuring compatibility with existing Bitcoin systems.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes functions like `murmur_hash3` for additional cryptographic operations and utilities like `read_le64`, allowing low-level manipulations necessary for performance-critical operations.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-hash = "0.1.20"
```

## Usage
Below is a simple example to hash a byte slice using `hash1`:
```rust
extern crate bitcoin_hash;
use bitcoin_hash::{hash1};

let data = b"Some data";
let hash_result = hash1(data);
println!("Hash256 of data: {:?}", hash_result);
```
