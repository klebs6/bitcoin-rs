# bitcoin-sha1

`bitcoin-sha1` is a Rust crate designed to implement the SHA-1 hashing algorithm tailored for Bitcoin-related cryptographic applications. Harnessing the algorithmic efficiency intrinsic to SHA-1, this crate provides robust mechanisms to hash data blocks with a focus on security and computational integrity.

### Overview

The SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value from an input of any length. While traditionally superseded by more secure algorithms like SHA-256 due to collision vulnerabilities, it remains a relevant specification in legacy systems and protocols.

This crate offers comprehensive capabilities for performing SHA-1 hash transformations with precision. Functions such as `sha1_transform`, `sha1_round`, and `sha1_initialize` provide the means to process data blocks effectively. The `Sha1` struct encapsulates state management with utilities to write, finalize, and reset hash computations.

### Features
- Implements core SHA-1 algorithms using low-level Rust operations.
- Provides high performance through inline function attributes.
- Flexible buffer management with the `write` and `finalize` methods in `Sha1`.
- Capability to handle message blocks up to arbitrary byte lengths.

### Usage

First, instantiate the `Sha1` hasher:

```rust
let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
```

For input data, use:

```rust
let data: &[u8] = b"your data here";
hasher.write(data.as_ptr(), data.len());
```

To obtain the final hash, finalize:

```rust
let mut output = [0u8; 20];
hasher.finalize(&mut output);
```

Resetting the hasher for new data:

```rust
hasher.reset();
```

### Safety Concerns

- Operations involving pointers (`*mut u8`, `*const u8`) demand stringent safety checks.
- Care must be taken to ensure buffer boundaries and memory accesses are respected.
