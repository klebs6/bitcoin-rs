# bitcoinleveldb-arena

`bitcoinleveldb-arena` is a Rust library that provides an efficient, memory-managed allocation system inspired by Google's LevelDB implementation. This crate ensures optimized memory usage through an arena allocation strategy, which is beneficial for high-performance applications requiring frequent allocations and deallocations.

## Features

- **Optimized Memory Allocation:** Utilizes an arena-based allocator, reducing the overhead associated with frequent allocations in long-running applications.
- **Alignment Support:** Provides aligned memory allocation for enhanced performance on specific architectures.
- **Pseudo-random Number Generation:** Includes a simple linear congruential generator (LCG) for generating pseudo-random numbers, ideal for simulations and randomized processes.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` to start using `bitcoinleveldb-arena`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoinleveldb-arena = "0.1.19"
```

### Example

Here is a basic example of how the arena allocator can be used:

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb-arena::Arena;

fn main() {
    let mut arena = Arena::default();
    let ptr = arena.allocate(128);
    println!("Allocated 128 bytes at {:?}", ptr);
    // Additional operations...
}
```
