# BitcoinLevelDB LogReader

## Overview

The `bitcoinleveldb-logreader` crate is a robust Rust library designed to facilitate reading logs in the LevelDB storage engine used by Bitcoin and other systems that require either intensive data processing or robust error correction.

It provides tools for handling large data sets efficiently by reading logs sequentially from files, while effectively managing errors and corruption through the `LogReaderReporter` interface. It can verify checksums if desired, and is designed to handle fragmented records gracefully.

## Key Features

- Sequential reading of log records from file systems with `SequentialFile` trait implementation.
- Built-in corruption detection and reporting via customizable `LogReaderReporter` interface.
- Flexible starting points for reading logs using the `initial_offset` parameter to manage large volumes of data.

## Technical Description

- **LogReader**: Manages reading from a log file, detects and reports errors, verifies checksums, and synchronizes reading positions using an offset-based approach.
- **LogReaderReporter**: Customizable error handling interface for corruption reporting.

## Usage

```rust
let log_reader = LogReader::new(
    Box::new(MySequentialFileImplementation),
    Box::new(MyLogReaderReporterImplementation),
    true,
    0
);

default_value.read_record(&mut my_record, &mut my_scratch_buffer);
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation handles checksum verification and manages a buffer for efficient block-level log record processing. It supports resynchronization through its offset management and guarantees safe memory practices using `Box`, ensuring memory is deallocated correctly with customized `Drop` logic.
