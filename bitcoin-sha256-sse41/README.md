# bitcoin-sha256-sse41

## Overview

`bitcoin-sha256-sse41` is a Rust crate designed to efficiently compute the SHA-256 double hash function (SHA256d) utilizing the SSE4.1 instruction set for 4-way parallel processing. This crate is especially beneficial for high-performance cryptographic applications, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency operations, where SHA-256 is a fundamental component.

## Features

- **SSE4.1 Optimization**: Leverages SIMD (`Single Instruction, Multiple Data`) capabilities to perform hashing operations in parallel, allowing for substantial performance benefits especially on workloads involving large volumes of data.
- **Support for 4-way Parallel Processing**: The core functionality supports computing hashes for four data blocks simultaneously, increasing throughput.
- **Comprehensive Interface**: Includes various utilities for vector arithmetic, bitwise operations, and SHA-256-specific transformations.

## Interface

The primary function provided by this crate is:

```rust
pub fn sha256d64_sse41_transform_4way(out: *mut u8, in_: *const u8);
```

This function computes the SHA256d hash over the input data, utilizing an intermediate transformation stage optimized with SSE4.1.

## Mathematical Concepts

SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions, known for producing a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from any input data. The algorithm employs a series of bitwise operations, modular addition, and round constants over a number of iterations to ensure the diffusion of input entropy across the hash output, characteristic to cryptographic security.

## Usage

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-sha256-sse41 = "0.1.1"
```

Use the `sha256d64_sse41_transform_4way` function to perform hashing on blocks of data:

```rust
let mut output: [u8; 32] = [0u8; 32];
let input: [u8; 64] = [ /* your input data */ ];

unsafe {
    bitcoin_sha256_sse41::sha256d64_sse41_transform_4way(output.as_mut_ptr(), input.as_ptr());
}
```
