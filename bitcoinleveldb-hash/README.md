# bitcoinleveldb-hash

`bitcoinleveldb-hash` is a Rust crate that implements a hashing function specifically designed for use with the LevelDB storage management system, often used in blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin. This function computes a 32-bit hash of a given byte sequence, tailored to the characteristics required by LevelDB for efficient data retrieval and storage.

## Features

- **Custom LevelDB Hashing**: The crate provides a single function `leveldb_hash` to compute a hash using the LevelDB algorithm.
- **Performance**: Utilizes bitwise operations and low-level memory management for high performance.
- **Flexibility**: Supports seeding for hash diversification.

## Usage

To use this crate, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoinleveldb-hash = "0.1.19"
```

### Function

```rust
pub fn leveldb_hash(data: *const u8, n: usize, seed: u32) -> u32
```

**Parameters**:
- `data`: A pointer to the byte array to hash.
- `n`: The number of bytes to hash.
- `seed`: A seed to mix into the hash, allowing varied outputs for otherwise identical inputs.

**Returns**: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the computed hash.
