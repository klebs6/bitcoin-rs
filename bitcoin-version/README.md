# bitcoin-version

`bitcoin-version` is a specialized Rust crate designed to support version formatting and metadata management for Bitcoin-based projects. This crate efficiently constructs version strings that conform to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP 14, ensuring standardized software release identification. The macro and functions inside are meticulously optimized for seamless integration within larger cryptocurrency ecosystems.

## Features

- **Version Formatting**: Facilitates formatting of numeric version identifiers into a major.minor.patch format.
- **Version Metadata**: Dynamically generates build metadata including commit hashes and tags for development version differentiation.
- **Sub-Version Formatting**: Constructs a comprehensive version string including client name, version number, and additional version comments.

## Usage

Add `bitcoin-version` as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-version = "0.1.19"
```

Use the provided macro and functions to generate version information:

```rust
use bitcoin_version::{format_version, format_full_version, format_sub_version};

let version = format_version(1002003); // "1.2.3"
let full_version = format_full_version(); // Provides detailed version string
let sub_version = format_sub_version(&"BitcoinClient".to_string(), 1002003, &vec!["comment1".to_string(), "comment2".to_string()]);
```

## Integration

This crate can be a crucial component in the development lifecycle of Bitcoin nodes, wallets, and other FinTech platforms relying on Bitcoin protocols by providing standardized version management.
