# bitcoin-argsman

`bitcoin-argsman` is a Rust crate designed for advanced management of command-line arguments within the context of Bitcoin-based software systems. The crate provides a comprehensive set of utilities to parse, interpret, and manage various command-line arguments and configurations used by Bitcoin nodes and applications. This crate enables flexible and robust management of node configurations and command invocations, particularly in environments where precise argument handling is paramount.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Argument Parsing**: Supports standard argument types including Boolean, integer, and string options, with structured handling of network-specific configurations.
- **Command Management**: Facilitates the addition, parsing, and execution of command-style arguments, tailored for Bitcoin node and application operations.
- **Network-aware Settings**: Ensures configuration parameters are correctly applied across different network types (e.g., mainnet, testnet).
- **Config File Integration**: Reads and applies settings from configuration files, with support for dynamic inclusion of additional config files.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error reporting mechanisms for configurations, enhancing debugging and runtime stability.

## Technical Overview

The crate is centered around the `ArgsManager` and `ArgsManagerInner` types, which manage command-line arguments and configurations. These structures handle setting validation, argument caching, and provide interfaces for querying the current settings and execution context. You can customize and expand settings dynamically while adhering to network-specific rules, preventing cross-contamination across network environments.

The crate also defines various enumerations such as `OptionsCategory` that categorize command-line options and settings based on functionality (e.g., CONNECTION, WALLET, BLOCK_CREATION). This organization aids in structured parameter management and efficient command execution.

## Usage

To use `bitcoin-argsman`, incorporate it into your project by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`. Then, use the provided utilities to add and manage arguments within your Bitcoin applications. Define command-line interfaces that suit your project's needs, and leverage network-aware capabilities to ensure consistent behavior across different blockchain environments.

```rust
use bitcoin_argsman::ArgsManager;

let mut args_manager = ArgsManager::default();
args_manager.setup_cli_args();

if args_manager.help_requested() {
    println!("{}", args_manager.get_help_message());
}
// Further configuration and execution logic follows...
```
