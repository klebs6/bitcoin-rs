        // do not interfere with select() loops. On 64-bit Unix hosts this value is
        // also OK, because up to that amount LevelDB will use an mmap
        // implementation that does not use extra file descriptors (the fds are
        // closed after being mmap'ed).

        // Increasing the value beyond the default is dangerous because LevelDB will
        // fall back to a non-mmap implementation when the file count is too large.
        // On 32-bit Unix host we should decrease the value because the handles use
        // up real fds, and we want to avoid fd exhaustion issues.
