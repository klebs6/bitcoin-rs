# bitcoin-u160 Crate

## Overview

The `bitcoin-u160` crate provides a data type representing a 160-bit opaque blob, catering specifically to the needs of applications requiring such a structure. The primary type exported by this crate is `u160`, which is designed for situations demanding a compact and immutable 160-bit storage without the overhead of traditional integer operations.

## Technical Specification

The `u160` struct does not support arithmetic operations; it serves as an immutable 160-bit container, commonly used in cryptographic and blockchain applications, such as Bitcoin, where fixed size and fast comparison operations are crucial.

Here are the primary features and operations defined in the crate:

- **Instantiation from different types:**
  - Convert from a hexadecimal string (`&str` or `&String`).
  - Construct from a raw 20-byte vector (`&Vec<u8>`) or a 20-byte array (`[u8; 20]`).
- **Core Traits Implementations:**
  - Implements standard traits such as `Clone`, `Default`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, and `Hash`.
  - Supports formatting traits like `Debug` and `Display` for easy inspection.
- **Internal Data Accessibility:**
  - Access internal byte slice with `AsRef<[u8]>` and `AsMut<[u8]>`.
  - `Deref` and `DerefMut` are implemented to allow transparent access and mutation of the internal `BaseBlob160` representation.

## Important Details

- **Endianness Handling:**
  - The `from_le_bytes` method converts a little-endian byte array to a `u160`, ensuring correct byte-ordering for integration with broader systems where endianness is explicitly defined.

## Usage

Add `bitcoin-u160` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-u160 = "0.1.19"
```

Example:

```rust
use bitcoin_u160::u160;

let hash = u160::from("0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdefabcdef01");
println!("Hash: {}", hash);
```
