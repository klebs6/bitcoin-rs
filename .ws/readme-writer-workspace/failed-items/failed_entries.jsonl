The core functionality hinges on restricting syscalls, thereby minimizing attack vectors and fortifying the application against system-level threats.\\n\\n## Overview\\nThis crate embodies a port from C++ to Rust, mirroring established syscall handling and policy enforcement patterns from Bitcoin Core. By defining clear policies via `SyscallSandboxPolicy`, users can throttle system capabilities progressively while maintaining operational integrity. Additionally, `SyscallSandboxAction` delineates systemic responses to disallowed syscalls, ensuring an adaptive and responsive security schema.\\n\\n## Core Features\\n- **Structured Syscall Policies:** Utilize predefined policies to delineate syscall access during `bitcoind` operations. Policies like `Initialization`, `NET`, and `SHUTOFF` represent the tiered access levels enforced at runtime.\\n- **BPF Programs:** The `SeccompPolicyBuilder` constructs BPF programs, permitting syscall whitelisting in accordance with security rigor.\\n- **Signal Handling and Debugging:** Integrates a debug signal handler for syscall violations, empowering users to diagnose unauthorized syscall invocations through comprehensive diagnostics.\\n- **Compliant and Robust:** Abides by rigorous Linux security protocols with seamless integration into existing infrastructural workflows.\\n\\n## Usage\\n```rust\\n// Example usage\\nlet policy = SyscallSandboxPolicy::NET;\\nset_syscall_sandbox_policy(policy);\\n```\\n\\nEnsure that the experimental features are enabled and the environment satisfies the Linux x86_64 requirements to fully capitalize on the security benefits conferred by this crate.\\n\\n## License\\nLicensed under the MIT License. \\n\\n-- \\n\\n*This README.md was generated by an AI model.
