The core functionality hinges on restricting syscalls, thereby minimizing attack vectors and fortifying the application against system-level threats.\n\n## Overview\nThis crate embodies a port from C++ to Rust, mirroring established syscall handling and policy enforcement patterns from Bitcoin Core. By defining clear policies via `SyscallSandboxPolicy`, users can throttle system capabilities progressively while maintaining operational integrity. Additionally, `SyscallSandboxAction` delineates systemic responses to disallowed syscalls, ensuring an adaptive and responsive security schema.\n\n## Core Features\n- **Structured Syscall Policies:** Utilize predefined policies to delineate syscall access during `bitcoind` operations. Policies like `Initialization`, `NET`, and `SHUTOFF` represent the tiered access levels enforced at runtime.\n- **BPF Programs:** The `SeccompPolicyBuilder` constructs BPF programs, permitting syscall whitelisting in accordance with security rigor.\n- **Signal Handling and Debugging:** Integrates a debug signal handler for syscall violations, empowering users to diagnose unauthorized syscall invocations through comprehensive diagnostics.\n- **Compliant and Robust:** Abides by rigorous Linux security protocols with seamless integration into existing infrastructural workflows.\n\n## Usage\n```rust\n// Example usage\nlet policy = SyscallSandboxPolicy::NET;\nset_syscall_sandbox_policy(policy);\n```\n\nEnsure that the experimental features are enabled and the environment satisfies the Linux x86_64 requirements to fully capitalize on the security benefits conferred by this crate.\n\n## License\nLicensed under the MIT License. \n\n-- \n\n*This README.md was generated by an AI model. While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, users should verify the content for precision and application correctness.*"
