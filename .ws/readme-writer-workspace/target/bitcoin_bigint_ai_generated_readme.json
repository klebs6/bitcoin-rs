  "full_readme_markdown": "# bitcoin-bigint\n\n`bitcoin-bigint` is a Rust library that offers a macro-based system to define arbitrary-precision unsigned integer operations. It caters to Bitcoin and cryptography needs where manipulating large integers safely and efficiently is crucial.\n\n## Overview\nThis crate provides macros that define large unsigned integer types (`BaseUInt32`, `BaseUInt64`, `BaseUInt128`, `BaseUInt160`, `BaseUInt256`) along with their associated arithmetic operations. Using these macros, developers can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations, and shifts on large integers with adjustable bit-width.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Arbitrary Precision**: Define unsigned integers with sizes from 32 bits to 256 bits.\n- **Comprehensive Operations**: Full suite of arithmetic, bitwise, and shift operations tailored to large integers.\n- **Hexadecimal Support**: Convert integers to and from hexadecimal string representation seamlessly.\n- **Random Generation**: Simple random number generator for testing and utility functions.\n\n## Usage\nTo use the `bitcoin-bigint` crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nbitcoin-bigint = \"0.1.18\"\n```\n\nThen, you can define your own unsigned integer operations:\n\n```rust\nuse bitcoin_bigint::{bigint, BaseUInt256};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut num = BaseUInt256::from(100u64);\n    let addend = BaseUInt256::from(50u64);\n    num += &addend;\n    println!(\"Result of addition: {}\", num.to_string());\n}\n```\n\n## Repository\nFor more information and to contribute, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/klebz/bitcoin-rs).\n\n## License\nLicensed under MIT License.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe README.md file is generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.",
