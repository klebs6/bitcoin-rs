  "full_readme_markdown": "# bitcoin-arena\n\n`bitcoin-arena` is a custom memory allocation crate in Rust mimicking manual memory management with arena-based allocations. The primary goal of this crate is to enhance high-performance applications where control over memory layout is crucial. It provides a mechanism to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory chunks.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Arena Allocation**: Allocate and free memory blocks with minimal overhead.\n- **Efficient Memory Management**: Uses `BTreeMap` and `HashMap` to keep track of free and used memory blocks.\n- **Safety**: Ensures allocated pointers remain within the bounds of the arena.\n- **Statistics**: Offers statistics on memory usage via the ` ArenaStats` struct.\n\n## Overview\n\nAn `Arena` is initialized with a base pointer, size, and alignment requirement. It supports:\n\n- **Allocation**: Best-fit strategy to find available memory blocks while respecting alignment constraints.\n- **Deallocation**: Prevents double-free errors and coalesces adjacent free blocks. \n- **Statistics Reporting**: Provides memory usage statistics (`used`, `free`, `total`, etc.).\n\n### Example Usage\n```rust\nlet mut arena = Arena::new(base_ptr, arena_size, alignment);\nlet ptr = arena.alloc(256);\narena.free(ptr);\nlet stats = arena.stats();\n```\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\nThe crate uses raw pointers, necessitating caution to ensure memory safety. Proper handling of the lifetime of the memory arena is necessary.\n\n## License\n\n`bitcoin-arena` is licensed under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, although it should be pretty good.*",
