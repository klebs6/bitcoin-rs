  "full_readme_markdown": "# bitcoin-u256\n\n`bitcoin-u256` is a robust and efficient Rust crate designed for handling 256-bit unsigned integers, commonly used in Bitcoin computations. This crate provides a comprehensive API that supports various operations, conversions, and abstractions essential for cryptographic and blockchain contexts.\n\n## Features\n\n- **256-bit Opaque Blob**: Defined as `u256`, this structure enables storage and manipulation of 256-bit integers efficiently, with methods to seamlessly convert between different formats.\n\n- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implements basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division under the `ArithU256` structure. It wraps low-level operations to maintain precision and uphold performance.\n\n- **Compact Representation**: Supports compact format conversions, essential for representing whole numbers in a format akin to floating point, which is used in Bitcoin for encoding difficulty targets.\n\n- **Endian-safe Conversions**: Compatible with Bitcoin's endian representation requirements through functions that correctly convert and interpret byte orders.\n\n- **Hash and Serialization**: Implements standard Rust traits for hashing, comparison, serialization, and deserialization, ensuring seamless integration with other Rust ecosystem tools and libraries.\n\n- **Checkpoints Handling**: Offers a way to manage checkpoints by associating block heights with `u256`, critical for maintaining synchronization points in blockchain progression.\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse bitcoin_u256::{u256, ArithU256};\n\nfn main() {\n    // Initialize a zeroed `u256`\n    let default_u256 = u256::default();\n    println!(\"Default u256: {}\", default_u256);\n\n    // Example: Hashing and comparison of `u256`\n    let another_u256 = u256::from_bytes_32([0u8; 32]);\n    assert_eq!(default_u256, another_u256);\n\n    // Arithmetic operations using `ArithU256`\n    let mut value = ArithU256::from(42);\n    value += 10;\n    println!(\"ArithU256 value: {}\", value);\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
