This crate exposes the same high‑level policy buckets and enforcement semantics as the upstream C++ implementation, enabling you to harden long‑running Bitcoin‑adjacent services (or any Linux x86‑64 daemon) against unexpected syscall usage.\n\n> NOTE: This README was generated by an AI model. It may not perfectly reflect the code, but it should be a close, technically coherent approximation. Always consult the source.\n\n---\n\n## Features at a Glance\n\n- **Policy‑driven syscall sandboxing** via `SyscallSandboxPolicy` – maps closely to Bitcoin Core thread roles.\n- **Allow‑list enforcement** using Linux **seccomp‑BPF** filters.\n- **Configurable violation behavior** via `SyscallSandboxAction`:\n  - Kill offending process.\n  - Trigger a SIGSYS debug handler that logs the violating syscall, then aborts.\n- **Deterministic, monotone restriction model**: once enabled, capabilities can *only* be reduced.\n- **Thread‑scoped enforcement**: each call to `set_syscall_sandbox_policy` installs a filter for the current thread and its descendants.\n- **Portable API**: on non‑Linux‑x86_64, the crate compiles but behaves as a no‑op shim.\n\nThis crate is especially appropriate when you want to adopt Bitcoin Core's syscall hardening strategy in Rust code, or when embedding Rust components into a hardened `bitcoind`-like environment.\n\n---\n\n## Platform and Safety Model\n\n- **Supported for enforcement**: `target_os = \"linux\"`, `target_arch = \"x86_64\"`, built with the `USE_SYSCALL_SANDBOX` cfg.\n- **All other targets**: the same public API exists, but functions are effectively no‑ops and simply return conservative defaults. This allows unconditional dependency in cross‑platform crates.\n- **Privilege monotonicity**: once `setup_syscall_sandbox` succeeds and `set_syscall_sandbox_policy` installs a filter, the process cannot regain previously dropped syscall capabilities. This is enforced by `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)`.\n\nInternally, each policy maps to a set of allowed syscall numbers, which are compiled into a seccomp BPF program. At runtime the kernel evaluates `seccomp_data.nr` against that allow‑list, permitting or terminating the calling task according to the configured default action.\n\n---\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### SyscallSandboxPolicy\n\n`SyscallSandboxPolicy` categorizes workloads into coarse \"buckets\" that are tuned for specific operational phases of a Bitcoin‑style node:\n\n```rust\npub enum SyscallSandboxPolicy {\n    Initialization,\n    InitializationDnsSeed,\n    InitializationLoadBlocks,\n    InitializationMapPort,\n    MESSAGE_HANDLER,\n    NET,\n    NET_ADD_CONNECTION,\n    NET_HTTP_SERVER,\n    NET_HTTP_SERVER_WORKER,\n    NET_OPEN_CONNECTION,\n    SCHEDULER,\n    TOR_CONTROL,\n    TX_INDEX,\n    VALIDATION_SCRIPT_CHECK,\n    SHUTOFF,\n}\n```\n\nSemantically (mirroring the C++ code):\n\n- **Initialization** / **InitializationDnsSeed** / **InitializationMapPort**:\n  - Most permissive profiles used during early startup.\n  - Allow network and filesystem operations.\n- **InitializationLoadBlocks**:\n  - Filesystem access only (e.g., block files, state, index data), no additional networking beyond the default set.\n- **MESSAGE_HANDLER**, **SCHEDULER**, **TX_INDEX**:\n  - Steady‑state workers that require filesystem I/O but no direct network initiation.\n- **NET**, **NET_ADD_CONNECTION**, **NET_HTTP_SERVER**, **NET_HTTP_SERVER_WORKER**, **NET_OPEN_CONNECTION**, **TOR_CONTROL**:\n  - Network‑intensive components.\n  - Allow relevant socket operations & filesystem access.\n- **VALIDATION_SCRIPT_CHECK**:\n  - Extremely constrained execution; relies on the minimal default syscall set defined in `SeccompPolicyBuilder::default`.\n- **SHUTOFF**:\n  - Late shutdown profile permitting basic filesystem operations to flush and close resources.\n\nPolicies are **monotone** in power: `Initialization` is constructed as a strict superset of all other policies, and later policy applications cannot restore previously removed syscalls.\n\n### SyscallSandboxAction\n\nControls the **default reaction** when an unlisted syscall is attempted after a filter is active:\n\n```rust\npub enum SyscallSandboxAction {\n    KILL_PROCESS,\n    INVOKE_SIGNAL_HANDLER,\n}\n```\n\n- `KILL_PROCESS` – the kernel uses `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS` to terminate the process immediately.\n- `INVOKE_SIGNAL_HANDLER` – the kernel uses `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP`, delivering `SIGSYS` to the offending thread. The crate registers `syscall_sandbox_debug_signal_handler` to:\n  - Read the offending syscall number from the `ucontext_t` (RAX).\n  - Resolve the symbolic name via `get_linux_syscall_name`.\n  - Determine the logical thread name via `thread_get_internal_name`.\n  - Log an explicit error and abort.\n\nThis makes it straightforward to identify missing allow‑list entries during development or test by intentionally causing violations.\n\n---\n\n## High‑Level Usage\n\n### 1. Enable the sandbox\n\nCall `setup_syscall_sandbox` once early in process initialization (typically on the main thread, before spawning worker threads):\n\n```rust\nuse bitcoin_syscall::setup_syscall_sandbox;\n\nfn main() {\n    // If true, use SIGSYS reporting before termination.\n    let log_before_terminate = true;\n\n    if !setup_syscall_sandbox(log_before_terminate) {\n        // On supported platforms, a `false` result indicates a failure to\n        // install the debug handler. The sandbox itself will *not* be active.\n        eprintln!(\"Failed to set up syscall sandbox debug handler\");\n    }\n\n    // From this point onwards, you can apply specific policies per thread.\n}\n```\n\nSemantics:\n\n- Ensures `SetupSyscallSandbox` is only executed once (further calls panic).\n- Sets the global mode `G_SYSCALL_SANDBOX_ENABLED`.\n- Configures whether violations trigger the debug signal handler.\n- Immediately installs the **Initialization** policy as the most permissive baseline.\n\nOn unsupported platforms this returns `false` and performs no enforcement.\n\n### 2. Apply policies per thread\n\nEach worker thread should adopt an appropriate policy as soon as its functional role is known.\n\n```rust\nuse bitcoin_syscall::{\n    set_syscall_sandbox_policy,\n    SyscallSandboxPolicy,\n};\n\nfn spawn_network_worker() {\n    std::thread::spawn(|| {\n        // Mark this thread as a network thread before performing network I/O.\n        set_syscall_sandbox_policy(SyscallSandboxPolicy::NET);\n\n        // ... network event loop, connection management, etc.\n    });\n}\n\nfn spawn_validation_worker() {\n    std::thread::spawn(|| {\n        set_syscall_sandbox_policy(SyscallSandboxPolicy::VALIDATION_SCRIPT_CHECK);\n\n        // Execute script validation tasks with an aggressive sandbox.\n    });\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n- Calling `set_syscall_sandbox_policy` when the global sandbox is not enabled is a no‑op (compatible with the C++ logic).\n- When enabled, it builds and installs a seccomp BPF filter for the **current thread** using the relevant methods on `SeccompPolicyBuilder`.\n- You can tighten restrictions over time (e.g., early initialization → steady state) but cannot re‑expand capabilities.\n\n### 3. Testing your policies\n\n`test_disallowed_sandbox_call` triggers a syscall (`getgroups`) assumed *not* to be on any allow‑list. This is useful in unit tests to assert that your environment correctly enforces seccomp policies.\n\n```rust\nuse bitcoin_syscall::{\n    setup_syscall_sandbox,\n    set_syscall_sandbox_policy,\n    SyscallSandboxPolicy,\n    test_disallowed_sandbox_call,\n};\n\n#[test]\nfn sandbox_violations_are_handled() {\n    if !setup_syscall_sandbox(true) {\n        // On unsupported platforms, skip.\n        return;\n    }\n\n    set_syscall_sandbox_policy(SyscallSandboxPolicy::MESSAGE_HANDLER);\n\n    // This should terminate the process or raise SIGSYS\n    // depending on configuration, so typically you run it in\n    // a subprocess / integration test harness.\n    test_disallowed_sandbox_call();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Low‑Level API Surface\n\n### `SeccompPolicyBuilder`\n\n`SeccompPolicyBuilder` is a thin builder around a `HashSet<u32>` of syscall numbers. It exists primarily as an internal mechanism to mirror the upstream C++ definitions, but it is public and can be used directly if you need a custom profile.\n\n```rust\npub struct SeccompPolicyBuilder {\n    allowed_syscalls: HashSet<u32>,\n}\n```\n\nThe `Default` implementation pre‑allows a base set of syscalls required for typical user‑space operation:\n\n- Address space operations: `mmap`, `mprotect`, `madvise`, `brk`, etc.\n- Epoll: `epoll_create1`, `epoll_ctl`, `epoll_wait`, `epoll_pwait`.\n- Futexes: `futex`, `set_robust_list`.\n- Eventfd, pipes, `prctl`, sleep, signal handling, process lifecycle, etc.\n- Minimal introspection (`getrlimit`, `getrusage`, `sysinfo`, `uname`).\n\nAdditional capability sets can be enabled incrementally via methods such as:\n\n- `allow_file_system()` – directory and file metadata operations (`open`, `fstat`, `getdents{,64}`, `rename`, `statx`, etc.).\n- `allow_network()` – socket creation and connection (`socket`, `bind`, `accept`, `connect`, `listen`, `setsockopt`, `socketpair`).\n- `allow_network_socket_information()` – `getsockname`, `getpeername`, `getsockopt`.\n- `allow_general_io()` – read/write, vectored I/O, polling, and socket send/recv.\n- `allow_get_random()`, `allow_get_time()`, `allow_global_system_status()`, etc.\n\nThe key constructor is:\n\n```rust\nimpl SeccompPolicyBuilder {\n    pub fn build_filter(&mut self, default_action: SyscallSandboxAction) -> Vec<libc::sock_filter> { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n`build_filter` assembles the BPF instruction sequence equivalent to the macros in `seccomp-bpf.h`:\n\n1. Load architecture from `seccomp_data.arch` and compare with `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64`. If not equal, kill the process.\n2. Load the syscall number from `seccomp_data.nr`.\n3. For each allowed syscall, emit a conditional jump and an `ALLOW` return.\n4. Emit a final `RET` with either `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS` or `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP` depending on `default_action`.\n\nThe resulting program can be handed directly to `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, ...)`.\n\n### Debug and Introspection Helpers\n\n- `get_linux_syscall_name(syscall_number: u32) -> String`\n  - Looks up a numeric syscall in the `LINUX_SYSCALLS` table.\n  - Returns `\"*unknown*\"` if not present.\n- `thread_get_internal_name() -> String`\n  - Returns the current thread's logical name.\n  - Uses `std::thread::current().name()` first, falling back to `pthread_getname_np` for unnamed threads.\n\nThese helpers are mostly used within the debug signal handler to provide high‑quality diagnostics when a disallowed syscall is encountered.\n\n### `syscall_sandbox_debug_signal_handler`\n\nA Rust port of Bitcoin Core's `SyscallSandboxDebugSignalHandler`:\n\n```rust\n#[no_mangle]\npub fn syscall_sandbox_debug_signal_handler(\n    _signal: i32,\n    signal_info: *mut siginfo_t,\n    void_signal_context: *mut c_void,\n) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n- Validates that `signal_info` and `ucontext_t` are non‑null and that the signal originated from seccomp (`si_code == SYS_SECCOMP_SI_CODE`).\n- Extracts RAX from the general registers, casts to `u32` as the syscall number, performs name lookup, and formats an error message that includes the thread name.\n- Logs to stderr and through the crate's logging target (`compat::syscall_sandbox`), then aborts.\n\nBecause it is marked `#[no_mangle]`, it can be referred to by C or C++ code if required for mixed‑language integration.\n\n---\n\n## Behavior on Unsupported Platforms\n\nFor targets other than Linux x86‑64, the crate exposes a `stubs` module with the same re‑exported API shape:\n\n- `setup_syscall_sandbox` and `setup_syscall_sandbox_debug_handler` return `false`.\n- `set_syscall_sandbox_policy` and `test_disallowed_sandbox_call` are no‑ops.\n- `SeccompPolicyBuilder::build_filter` returns an empty vector.\n- `get_linux_syscall_name` always returns `\"*unknown*\"`.\n\nThis design allows downstream code to unconditionally call the API while **feature‑gating enforcement behavior** on `cfg(all(target_os = \"linux\", target_arch = \"x86_64\"))` only when necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Notes\n\n- **Linkage & libc**: The crate relies on `libc`, seccomp constants, and `prctl`. When cross‑compiling, ensure that your toolchain provides the appropriate headers and sysroot.\n- **Thread model**: Filters are installed per‑thread. Typically you:\n  1. Call `setup_syscall_sandbox` on the main thread.\n  2. Spawn threads.\n  3. Immediately call `set_syscall_sandbox_policy` in each thread before performing I/O.\n- **Logging**: The crate uses Rust logging macros. Configure your logging subsystem to observe the `compat::syscall_sandbox` target for detailed diagnostics.\n- **Upstream alignment**: Field names, enum variants, and control flow are intentionally close to the upstream C++ in Bitcoin Core for ease of auditing and future porting.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nThis crate is distributed under the **MIT** license.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis README was programmatically generated by an AI model based on supplied interface and commentary.
