It caters to Bitcoin and cryptography needs where manipulating large integers safely and efficiently is crucial.\\n\\n## Overview\\nThis crate provides macros that define large unsigned integer types (`BaseUInt32`, `BaseUInt64`, `BaseUInt128`, `BaseUInt160`, `BaseUInt256`) along with their associated arithmetic operations. Using these macros, developers can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations, and shifts on large integers with adjustable bit-width.\\n\\n## Key Features\\n- **Arbitrary Precision**: Define unsigned integers with sizes from 32 bits to 256 bits.\\n- **Comprehensive Operations**: Full suite of arithmetic, bitwise, and shift operations tailored to large integers.\\n- **Hexadecimal Support**: Convert integers to and from hexadecimal string representation seamlessly.\\n- **Random Generation**: Simple random number generator for testing and utility functions.\\n\\n## Usage\\nTo use the `bitcoin-bigint` crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\\n\\n```toml\\n[dependencies]\\nbitcoin-bigint = \\\"0.1.18\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can define your own unsigned integer operations:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse bitcoin_bigint::{bigint, BaseUInt256};\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    let mut num = BaseUInt256::from(100u64);\\n    let addend = BaseUInt256::from(50u64);\\n    num += &addend;\\n    println!(\\\"Result of addition: {}\\\", num.to_string());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Repository\\nFor more information and to contribute, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/klebz/bitcoin-rs).\\n\\n## License\\nLicensed under MIT License.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\nThe README.md file is generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.\",\n    \"package_categories\": [\n        \"cryptography\",\n        \"mathematics\",\n        \"finance\",\n        \"algorithms\",\n        \"data-structures\"\n    ],\n    \"package_description\": \"Provides an efficient macro-based approach to define and manipulate arbitrary-precision unsigned integers, crucial for cryptographic operations on Bitcoin.\", \n    \"package_keywords\": [\n        \"bitcoin\",\n        \"bigint\",\n        \"arithmetic\",\n        \"cryptography\",\n        \"math\"\n    ]\n}\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 9651, "completion_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 10205, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8"}}, "error": null}
