It is specifically designed for the x86_64 architecture on a Linux operating system. The crate integrates system-level security by limiting the syscalls that a Bitcoin application can make, enforcing robust access control policies.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThis crate offers a series of predefined `SyscallSandboxPolicy` and `SyscallSandboxAction` to apply meticulous control over system interactions. The usage of `seccomp` effectively mitigates security risks by filtering system calls, thus ensuring enhanced operational integrity.\\n\\n### Features\\n- **Policy Enforcement**: Designate policies that limit accessible syscalls based on different phases of application execution.\\n- **Action Management**: Decide on actions like `KILL_PROCESS` or `INVOKE_SIGNAL_HANDLER` for violation handling.\\n- **Linux-Specific**: Explicitly crafted for Linux x86_64 environments, following industry standards and guidelines for kernel-level security.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nImport the crate and invoke its functions to set up a syscall sandbox:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse bitcoin_syscall::{set_syscall_sandbox_policy, SyscallSandboxPolicy};\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    set_syscall_sandbox_policy(SyscallSandboxPolicy::INITIALIZATION);\\n    // Your Bitcoin application's logic\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe mechanism is simple yet powerful, designed to be integrated seamlessly into any Bitcoin client that requires syscalls control for better security posturing.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Note: This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.*\",\n    \"package_categories\": [\n        \"security\",\n        \"network-programming\",\n        \"os\",\n        \"development-tools\",\n        \"cryptography\"\n    ],\n    \"package_description\": \"A Rust crate implementing a syscall sandbox for Bitcoin applications using Linux seccomp with BPF for enhanced operational integrity and security.\",\n    \"package_keywords\": [\n        \"bitcoin\",\n        \"syscall\",\n        \"seccomp\",\n        \"security\",\n        \"sandbox\"\n    ]\n}\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8988, "completion_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 10218, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 8960, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8"}}, "error": null}
