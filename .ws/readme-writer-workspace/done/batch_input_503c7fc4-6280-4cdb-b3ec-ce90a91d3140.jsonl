Use it, along with the content we sent you to generate an appropriate value for each.\n- Ensure that each generated field optimally serves its desired purpose.\n- Each item should be deep, detailed, and specific. Use optimally descriptive and useful language. Do not be too verbose.\n- Do not add any extra keys to the generated object. Generate precisely what we ask of you: no more, no less.\n- For fields which are of an enum type: pick *exactly one variant*. Do not generate any information for the unselected variants.\n- For array fields: supply a JSON list [ ... ] of items, each conforming to the correct item type.\n- For map fields: Provide a JSON object { \"key_as_string\": <value>, ... }. Keys must be valid JSON strings. Keys and Values must conform to the key and value schemas we provide to you. Fill all subfields of each and every map value.\n- If we ask you to justify a map field, provide your justification/confidence score for the entire map. Do not attempt to separately justify each map element.\n- Likewise, if we ask you to justify an array field, provide your justification/confidence score for the entire array.

In this finite field, addition is just XOR of the corresponding numbers. For example, {27}\n/// + {13} = {27 ^ 13} = {22}.\n/// Multiplication is more complicated, and requires treating the bits of values themselves as\n/// coefficients of a polynomial over a smaller field, GF(2), and multiplying those polynomials \n/// mod a^5 + a^3 + 1. \n///\n/// For example, \n/// {5} * {26} = (a^2 + 1) * (a^4 + a^3 + a) = (a^4 + a^3 + a) * a^2 + (a^4 + a^3 + a) = a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a = a^3 + 1 (mod a^5 + a^3 + 1) = {9}.\n/// During the course of the loop below, `c` contains the bitpacked coefficients of the polynomial\n/// constructed from just the values of v that were processed so far, mod g(x).\n/// In the above example, `c` initially corresponds to 1 mod g(x), and after processing 2 inputs of\n/// v, it corresponds to x^2 + v0*x + v1 mod g(x). As\n/// 1 mod g(x) = 1, that is the starting value for `c`.\n/// The following Sage code constructs the generator used:\n/// B = GF(2) # Binary field\n/// BP.<b> = B[] # Polynomials over the binary field\n/// F_mod = b**5 + b**3 + 1\n/// F.<f> = GF(32, modulus=F_mod, repr='int') # GF(32) definition\n/// FP.<x> = F[] # Polynomials over GF(32)\n/// E_mod = x**2 + F.fetch_int(9)*x + F.fetch_int(23)\n/// E.<e> = F.extension(E_mod) # GF(1024) extension field definition\n/// for p in divisors(E.order() - 1): # Verify e has order 1023.\n///    assert((e**p == 1) == (p % 1023 == 0))\n/// G = lcm([(e**i).minpoly() for i in range(997,1000)])\n/// print(G) # Print out the generator\n/// It demonstrates that g(x) is the least common multiple of the minimal polynomials of\n/// 3 consecutive powers (997,998,999) of a primitive element (e) of GF(1024).\n/// That guarantees it is, in fact, the generator of a primitive BCH code with cycle length 1023\n/// and distance 4.
