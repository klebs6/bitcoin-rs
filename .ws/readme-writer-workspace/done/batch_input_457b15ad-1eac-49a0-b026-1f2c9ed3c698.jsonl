Use it, along with the content we sent you to generate an appropriate value for each.\n- Ensure that each generated field optimally serves its desired purpose.\n- Each item should be deep, detailed, and specific. Use optimally descriptive and useful language. Do not be too verbose.\n- Do not add any extra keys to the generated object. Generate precisely what we ask of you: no more, no less.\n- For fields which are of an enum type: pick *exactly one variant*. Do not generate any information for the unselected variants.\n- For array fields: supply a JSON list [ ... ] of items, each conforming to the correct item type.\n- For map fields: Provide a JSON object { \"key_as_string\": <value>, ... }. Keys must be valid JSON strings. Keys and Values must conform to the key and value schemas we provide to you. Fill all subfields of each and every map value.\n- If we ask you to justify a map field, provide your justification/confidence score for the entire map. Do not attempt to separately justify each map element.\n- Likewise, if we ask you to justify an array field, provide your justification/confidence score for the entire array. Do not attempt to separately justify each element.\n- Provide numeric fields as real JSON numbers (not strings).\n- For string fields: provide the value precisely as a string literal. If optional, you may set it to null.\n- If we ask you to justify or provide confidence scores for the fields of a structure, please do so carefully. For each field we ask you to justify, please explain or justify your choice clearly. Confidence scores must be specified as real JSON numbers in the range `[0..1]`.\n- If we ask to you generate an optional field, either fill it or set it to null.\n- If we ask you to justify your choice of an enum variant, please explain your choice clearly. Do not justify your decision to leave a variant unselected. Provide your justification as a JSON string. Provide your confidence score as a real JSON number in the range `[0..1]`.\n- In terms of the JSON format we would like you to provide, the object itself will be deserialied based on the following schema. \n- We begin exactly at the top: the data should not be nested under a parent named 'fields' or anything similar.\n\n## Here is the schema to use:\n\nObject {\n    \"fields\": Object {\n        \"crate_name\": Object {\n            \"generation_instructions\": String(\"\\\"This string should be the name of our crate, *verbatim*, trimmed for use as a toml field\\\"\"),\n            \"required\": Bool(true),\n            \"type\": String(\"string\"),\n        },\n        \"full_readme_markdown\": Object {\n            \"generation_instructions\": String(\"\\\"This string should be valid markdown representing the readme for this crate.\\\\n\\\\n Please make it terse, useful, and designed for an industrious commercially savy consumer of industrious nature. \\\\n\\\\n Advanced vocabulary and concepts are welcome. \\\\n\\\\n If this crate involves concepts from mathematics and/or physics, please describe and document them here.\\\"\"),\n            \"required\": Bool(true),\n            \"type\": String(\"string\"),\n        },\n        \"package_categories\": Object {\n            \"generation_instructions\": String(\"\\\"These categories will be used in our Cargo.toml file.\\\\n\\\\n It is important that users of this crate can find it on crates.io.\\\\n\\\\n Choose maximum 5 categories and make sure they are actually meaningful for our crate.\\\\n\\\\n These categories should only be chosen from among the legal crates.io categories. \\\\n\\\\n The ONLY legal categoreis are:\\\\n\\\\n``\\\\n accessibility\\\\n aerospace\\\\n algorithms\\\\n api-bindings\\\\n asynchronous\\\\n authentication\\\\n caching\\\\n command-line-interface\\\\n command-line-utilities\\\\n compilers\\\\n compression\\\\n computer-vision\\\\n concurrency\\\\n config\\\\n cryptography\\\\n data-structures\\\\n database\\\\n database-implementations\\\\n date-and-time\\\\n development-tools\\\\n email\\\\n embedded\\\\n emulators\\\\n encoding\\\\n external-ffi-bindings\\\\n filesystem\\\\n finance\\\\n game-development\\\\n game-engines\\\\n games\\\\n graphics\\\\n gui\\\\n hardware-support\\\\n internationalization\\\\n localization\\\\n mathematics\\\\n memory-management\\\\n multimedia\\\\n network-programming\\\\n no-std\\\\n os\\\\n parser-implementations\\\\n parsing\\\\n rendering\\\\n rust-patterns\\\\n science\\\\n simulation\\\\n template-engine\\\\n text-editors\\\\n text-processing\\\\n value-formatting\\\\n virtualization\\\\n visualization\\\\n wasm\\\\n web-programming\\\\n ``\\\\n\\\\n DO NOT specify a category that is not on this list.\\\"\"),\n            \"required\": Bool(true),\n            \"type\": String(\"array_of_strings\"),\n        },\n        \"package_description\": Object {\n            \"generation_instructions\": String(\"\\\"We will place this package_description in our Cargo.toml file so the users of this crate\\\\n know what it does.\\\\n\\\\n The discription should be technical, clear, and useful.
