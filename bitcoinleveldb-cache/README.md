# bitcoinleveldb-cache

The `bitcoinleveldb-cache` crate implements a robust caching interface optimized for concurrent access across multiple threads using an internal synchronization mechanism. The cache supports automatic eviction of entries to accommodate new cache insertions, leveraging a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy for eviction.

## Features
- **Concurrent Safe**: Can be safely accessed and modified across multiple threads.
- **Customizable Eviction Policies**: While the default eviction policy is LRU, users can define custom eviction strategies for more sophisticated use cases.
- **Charge-Based Caching**: Each cache entry has a specific charge against the cache’s capacity, facilitating efficient memory management especially with dynamic data size.

## Functionality
This crate provides multiple traits and functions:
- **Cache Insertions, Lookups, and Releases**: Interface to add and retrieve cached items.
- **Capacity Management**: Control of cache size and observation of memory usage through `total_charge`.
- **ID Generation**: Unique ID assignment for cache entries via `new_id`.

### Example
An example instantiation of the LRU Cache:
```rust
let cache = bitcoinleveldb_cache::new_lru_cache(1024);
```

## Technical Details
The crate includes interfaces for encoding keys, decoding keys, and managing opaque handles for cache entries. These handles are implemented using Rust’s safe memory management paradigms, ensuring a secure and efficient caching mechanism.

## Conclusion
This crate provides a foundational base for building high-performance, thread-safe cache structures that can be extended for advanced caching scenarios, crucial for systems requiring high-throughput data access.
