# bitcoinleveldb-bloom

`bitcoinleveldb-bloom` is a Rust library providing an efficient Bloom filter policy implementation compatible with LevelDB. It enables rapid probabilistic set membership testing, often used in database query optimizations and fast in-memory data handling.

## Features

- Provides `BloomFilterPolicy` for creating Bloom filters to rapidly determine if an item may be in a set.
- Allows customization of bits per key to adjust false-positive rates according to your application's requirements.
- Includes detailed tracing for debugging and performance tuning.
- Offers compatibility with LevelDB's traditional Bloom filter API for cross-language consistency.

## Technical Overview

Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures used to test whether an element is part of a set, with a tunable false-positive rate. They are particularly useful when memory space is limited or when performance of membership tests is crucial.

The core implementation involves computing a fixed number of hash functions per key (`k`), determined based on the desired bits per key. Our crate adopts the Kirsch–Mitzenmacher method for efficient computation by utilizing double-hashing rather than distinct hash functions. This approach is both space and time efficient.

## Getting Started

To start using `bitcoinleveldb-bloom`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoinleveldb-bloom = "0.1.19"
```

## Example

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_bloom::{BloomFilterPolicy, Slice};

let policy = BloomFilterPolicy::new(10);
let mut filter: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
let keys = vec![b"key1", b"key2", b"key3"];

policy.create_filter_from_bytes(&keys, &mut filter);

assert!(policy.key_may_match_bytes(b"key1", &filter));
assert!(!policy.key_may_match_bytes(b"key_not_in_set", &filter));
```
