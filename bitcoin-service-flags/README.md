# bitcoin-service-flags

`bitcoin-service-flags` is a Rust crate designed to manage service flags within the Bitcoin network. These flags play a crucial role in determining the capabilities and services that a Bitcoin node advertises to other nodes, facilitating efficient network communication and ensuring robust functionality.

## Features

The crate provides:

- **Service Flags Definitions**: Handle different service flags like `NODE_NETWORK`, `NODE_BLOOM`, `NODE_WITNESS`, `NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS`, and more.
- **Flag Analysis**: Functions to evaluate which service flags make a peer desirable or useful.
- **Interoperability**: Implements conversion between raw bitfields and human-readable names for known flags, maintaining consistency with C++ implementations.
- **Desirable Flags Determination**: Analyze which service flags are deemed essential for establishing connections with peers.

## Usage

This crate relies on the [bitflags](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags) library to define and operate on service flags, ensuring efficient bitwise manipulation of flags. Here is an example usage within a Bitcoin client node:

```rust
use bitcoin_service_flags::{ServiceFlags, get_desirable_service_flags};

let current_flags = ServiceFlags::NODE_NETWORK | ServiceFlags::NODE_WITNESS;
let desirable_flags = get_desirable_service_flags(current_flags);

assert!(desirable_flags.contains(ServiceFlags::NODE_NETWORK));
```

## Mathematical Concepts

Service flags are represented as bitfields, which are a form of integer representation where each bit corresponds to a specific capability or feature. In this crate, they are implemented as `u64` integers using bitwise operations to interpret and manipulate these flags.

## Getting Started

To include this crate in your project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = { bitcoin-service-flags = "0.1.19" }
```
