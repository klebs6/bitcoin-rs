# bitcoin-network

The `bitcoin-network` crate is a sophisticated library designed for handling various network types and addresses within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This crate is especially adaptive in managing BIP155 network IDs and legacy network operations. Additional facilities include `NetAddr` structure implementations that facilitate advanced network address manipulations, ensuring robust connectivity through reliable address verification techniques.

## Overview

The crate offers functionality to handle a wide spectrum of network types such as IPv4, IPv6, TOR, I2P, and CJDNS, focusing on accurate and efficient address representation.

### Key Features
- **Network Type Enumeration:** Supports BIP155 and traditional network types.
- **Network Address Management:** Structures and functions to serialize and deserialize network addresses.
- **Connectivity Analysis:** Features to assess network reachability and reliability.

### Utilities
The `NetAddr` structure and related methods provide utilities for address conversions and validations based on network protocols. Functions like `ipv4_to_string`, `ipv6_to_string`, and `onion_to_string` are integral in rendering the correct string representation of network addresses compliant with respective standards like RFC 5952.

### Advanced Network Functions
1. **Checksum Verification:** Implements the TORv3 checksum via `torv3_checksum`.
2. **Reachability Metrics:** Using `get_reachability_from` to determine address reachability effectiveness.
3. **AS Mapping:** Allocates ASN-based address bucketing through `get_mappedas` for administratively responsible network diversification.

### Mathematical Operations
The function `netmask_bits` calculates the number of leading 1-bits in a subnet mask, integrating bitwise operations into network processing for precise subnet boundary identifications.

## Usage
With this crate, developers can efficiently manage network operations in Bitcoin-related applications, encompassing serialization, deserialization, protocol transition integrity, and compatibility checking.

- Advanced users can embed custom reachability strategies, serialize into legacy formats, or enable future-proof operation by interfacing with upcoming network standards.
