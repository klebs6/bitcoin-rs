# bitcoin-bech32m

`bitcoin-bech32m` is a Rust crate that provides utilities for encoding and decoding Bech32 and Bech32m formatted strings, as specified by BIP-173 and BIP-350. Primarily, it focuses on calculating checksums and encoding data in a human-readable and less error-prone format, often used in blockchain and cryptocurrency addresses.

## Key Features

- **Encoding and Decoding:** Ability to encode strings using Bech32 or Bech32m algorithms and validate these strings for correctness.
- **Checksum Validation:** Implements a robust mechanism for checksum validation, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of encoded data.
- **Encoding Constants:** Uses encoding-specific constants to abide by the BIP standards.

## Mathematical Background

Bech32 and Bech32m checksums are derived using polynomial division within a finite field ( GF(32) ). This involves operations such as adding or multiplying polynomials under modulo conditions. The `poly_mod` function is pivotal in this process, computing the remainder of the polynomial division and ensuring the detection of multiple errors within the encoded string effectively.

## Usage Example

```rust
use bitcoin_bech32m::{encode, decode, Encoding};

let hrp = String::from("bc");
let data = vec![0x02, 0x03, 0x04];
let encoded = encode(Encoding::BECH32, &hrp, &data);
assert_eq!(decode(&encoded).encoding(), &Encoding::BECH32);
```
