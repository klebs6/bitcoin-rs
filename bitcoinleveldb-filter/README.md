# Bitcoin LevelDB Filter

A Rust crate `bitcoinleveldb-filter`, utilized in efficiently managing filter policies and operations for Bitcoin's LevelDB. It facilitates the creation and reading of filter blocks, using strategies akin to Bloom filtering. This crate is a critical tool for any system seeking to implement efficient database querying methodologies.

## Overview

This crate implements core functions and traits for creating and managing filter blocks, integral for optimizing data retrieval in LevelDB. Specifically, it supports:

- **FilterPolicy**: A trait for defining custom filter logic.
- **CreateFilter**: A trait for assembling filters from key inputs.
- **KeyMayMatch**: A trait determining key presence probability in stored data.

### Core Structures

- **FilterBlockBuilder**: Constructs filter blocks, amalgamating multiple filters to facilitate block queries.
- **FilterBlockReader**: Enables parsing and querying of filter blocks for key presence.

## Features

- **bounded-memory checks**: Manages data integrity when handling slices and prevents buffer overflows.
- **Concurrency-ready structures**: Filters are equipped to handle concurrent queries efficiently.
