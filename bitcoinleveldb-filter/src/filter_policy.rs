/*!
  | A database can be configured with a custom
  | FilterPolicy object.  This object is
  | responsible for creating a small filter from
  | a set of keys.  These filters are stored in
  | leveldb and are consulted automatically by
  | leveldb to decide whether or not to read some
  | information from disk. In many cases, a filter
  | can cut down the number of disk seeks form
  | a handful to a single disk seek per DB::Get()
  | call.
  |
  | Most people will want to use the builtin bloom
  | filter support (see NewBloomFilterPolicy()
  | below).
