# `bitcoin-string`

The `bitcoin-string` crate provides a comprehensive suite of string manipulation and parsing utilities designed for cryptocurrency applications, particularly within Bitcoin-related contexts. This library is instrumental in sanitizing strings, converting between various numeral systems, and parsing fixed-point representations, all of which are crucial for handling financial data with precision and correctness.

## Features

- **String Sanitation & Manipulation**:
  - `sanitize_string`: Remove potentially unsafe characters based on predefined rules.
  - `trim_string`, `remove_prefix`, `join`, and `make_unordered_list`: Functions for trimming, manipulating prefixes, and joining strings.
  
- **Integer Parsing**:
  - Strict parsing for integers (`parse_int32`, `parse_int64`, etc.) with rigorous validation, rejecting malformed inputs based on strict format checks.

- **Locale-Independent Formatting**:
  - Conversion utilities like `to_upper`, `to_lower`, which independently handle ASCII to ensure locale-independent transformations.

- **Base Encoding**:
  - Encoding and decoding functionalities for Base32 and Base64, assisting in secure data representation and transmission.

- **Security-Conscious Operations**:
  - `timing_resistant_equal`: A function designed to mitigate timing attacks by ensuring constant-time equality checks over byte arrays.

- **Mathematical Precision**:
  - Functions like `parse_fixed_point` that abstract the complexities of handling fixed-point numbers in financial contexts.

## Mathematical Considerations

The crate abstracts the intricacies of fixed-point arithmetic using `parse_fixed_point` to manage large numbers typically encountered in financial transactions. This involves careful handling of mantissa and exponent transformations, with safeguards against overflow errors.

## Usage

Integrate `bitcoin-string` into your project by adding the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-string = "0.1.19"
```

The crate is an ideal choice for scenarios where precise string handling and secure numeric conversion are essential. Its design philosophy is practical elegance, offering powerful functionality with a focus on safety and correctness.
