# bitcoinleveldb-posixlogger

`bitcoinleveldb-posixlogger` provides a structured logging interface for applications utilizing the `POSIX` file system and wanting precise log management. The crate facilitates high-performance logging with efficient memory usage by leveraging mechanisms like stack-based buffering and dynamic buffer sizing. It is closely coupled with `libc`, ensuring the logger achieves minimal overhead operations directly on the system level.

## Features

- **POSIX Compliant:** Integrates tightly with POSIX, permitting direct manipulation of file descriptors for optimized logging.
- **Dynamic Buffer Management:** Utilizes two-phase buffering with adjustable sizes to ensure log entries are not lost even when the initial stack buffer is insufficient.
- **Time-Stamped Entries:** Automatically captures and formats time information from the system clock, providing detailed timestamps on each log entry.
- **Thread Identification:** Each log entry includes thread identification ensuring easy multi-threaded application debugging.
- **C-style String Format Support:** Mimics printf-style log argument substitution using format strings, making it adaptable for numerous logging scenarios.

## Usage

Integrate `PosixLogger` into your Rust application for efficient logging to files with the reliance on the underlying operating system’s file I/O through `libc`.

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_posixlogger::PosixLogger;
use std::fs::OpenOptions;

let file = OpenOptions::new()
    .write(true)
    .create(true)
    .open("logfile.log")
    .expect("Unable to open log file");

let logger = PosixLogger::new(file.as_raw_fd() as *mut libc::FILE);
logger.logv(c"%s %s\n", &["Example", "Log Entry"]);
```

## Ensured Quality

### Memory Management
Warning and error checks are abundantly threaded throughout the implementation to ensure that no memory overflows occur even under edge cases. The system's consistency remains uncompromised with the safe application of pointers.

### Log Quality
Logs are structured with a clear separation of header and body segments, assisting in readable logs even under high-frequency event tracking.

### Reliability
Leveraging POSIX ensures that the logger is well-integrated in Unix-affiliated systems, thus assuming standard compiled binary behavior across platforms.
