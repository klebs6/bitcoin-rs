# Bitcoin-Fees Crate

The `bitcoin-fees` crate provides robust utilities for estimating transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. Its design supports advanced fee calculation necessary for efficient Bitcoin transactions, catering to dynamic network conditions.

## Features

- **Fee Estimation Modes:** Utilize diverse fee estimation modes such as `ECONOMICAL`, `CONSERVATIVE`, `BTC_KVB`, and `SAT_VB` for tailored transaction evaluations.
- **Fee Filtering and Rounding:** Incorporate `FeeFilterRounder` to quantify minimal fees, enhancing privacy prior to transaction broadcast.
- **Sophisticated Fee Horizon Management:** `FeeEstimateHorizon` allows monitoring of transaction confirmations over variable time scales - short, medium, and long term. 
- **Precise Fee Calculation:** `FeeRate` structures allow conversion between different fee units and precise fee allocation for transactions of any byte size.

## Installation

Add `bitcoin-fees` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-fees = "0.1.21"
```

## Usage

```rust
use bitcoin_fees::{FeeRate, FeeEstimateMode, FeeCalculation};

let default_fee_rate = FeeRate::default();
let mut fee_calculation = FeeCalculation::new_with_fee_paid(1000, 250);

match fee_calculation.mode {
    FeeEstimateMode::ECONOMICAL => println!("Using an economical fee mode."),
    FeeEstimateMode::CONSERVATIVE => println!("Using a conservative fee mode."),
    _ => println!("Using the default fee mode."),
}
```
