# `bitcoinleveldb-status`

`bitcoinleveldb-status` is a Rust crate providing an implementation of status codes inspired by C++ conventions. It encapsulates the result of operations in a manner akin to LevelDB's status handling, supporting a range of result states including success and various types of errors such as NotFound, Corruption, NotSupported, InvalidArgument, and IOError. This is particularly useful in systems that require precise indication and communication of operational outcomes.

## Features
- Mimics LevelDB status handling.
- Move semantics parallels C++ concepts through ownership transfers.
- Provides a structured way to handle operation results.
- Includes convenience methods for common status and message handling patterns.

## Usage
The crate defines a `Status` struct that represents an operation's outcome and a `StatusCode` enum to capture specific error types. It allows seamless creation and evaluation of these statuses.

```rust
// Example of usage.
use bitcoinleveldb_status::{Status, StatusCode};

let ok_status = Status::ok();
assert!(ok_status.is_ok());

let not_found_status = Status::not_found("Resource missing", None);
assert!(not_found_status.is_not_found());
assert_eq!(not_found_status.to_string(), "NotFound: Resource missing");
```

### StatusCode Enum Values
- `Ok`: Represents success.
- `NotFound`: Resource not found.
- `Corruption`: Data corruption.
- `NotSupported`: Operation unsupported.
- `InvalidArgument`: Invalid input arguments.
- `IOError`: Input/output failure.

### Constructors
- `Status::ok()` - Creates a status representing success.
- `Status::not_found(msg, msg2)` - Helps in reporting not found errors.
- `Status::corruption(msg, msg2)` - Used for signaling data corruption.
- `Status::not_supported(msg, msg2)` - Indicates unsupported operations.
- `Status::invalid_argument(msg, msg2)` - Deals with failed preconditions.
- `Status::io_error(msg, msg2)` - Errors arising from IO operations.

### Advanced Features
Rust move semantics are utilized to optimize memory and resource management, providing constructor and assignment functions that parallel similar C++ pattern paradigms.
