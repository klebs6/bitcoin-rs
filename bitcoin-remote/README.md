# bitcoin-remote

`bitcoin-remote` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate interactions with remote Bitcoin clients using the JSON-RPC protocol. It offers a robust, thread-safe interface to handle the intricacies and error codes specific to Bitcoin's RPC interface, ensuring smooth and secure communication.

## Features

- **Reliable HTTP status handling**: Effortlessly manage a range of HTTP errors common in remote interactions, including `HTTP_NOT_FOUND` and `HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

- **Comprehensive RPC error management**: Leverage error codes defined in the Bitcoin protocol for precise error handling and troubleshooting. This includes errors like `RPC_INVALID_REQUEST` and `RPC_WALLET_ERROR`.

- **Auth cookie management**: Generate, read, and delete authentication cookies, maintaining secure and efficient access control.

- **JSON-RPC object construction**: Easily build request and reply objects in line with JSON-RPC standards.

- **Batch processing**: Parse batch replies, ensuring high compatibility with Bitcoin's wide adoption of batch operations.

## Installation

To use `bitcoin-remote`, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-remote = "0.1.22"
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example illustrating how to create a JSON-RPC request object:

```rust
use bitcoin_remote::{jsonrpc_request_obj, UniValue};

let method = "getblockchaininfo";
let params = UniValue::empty_array();
let id = UniValue::from(1);
let request = jsonrpc_request_obj(method, &params, &id);
println!("{}", request.write().expect("Failed to serialize request"));
```

This creates a request object for the `getblockchaininfo` method, ensuring idempotent interactions with a Bitcoin server.
