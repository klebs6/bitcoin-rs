# bitcoin-asmap

`bitcoin-asmap` is a Rust crate designed to parse, decode, and interpret ASMAP files, a structure used to implement IP-to-ASN mappings. Originally inspired by Bitcoin's C++ implementation, this crate provides a robust and comprehensive toolkit for handling ASMAP files, focusing on efficient bit-level operations and precise handling of potential structural errors.

## Features

- **ASMAP Parsing**: Reads ASMAP files from disk, interpreting the binary data as little-endian, LSB-first.
- **Instructions Decoding**: Offers support for decoding various instructions such as RETURN, JUMP, MATCH, and DEFAULT, providing comprehensive tracing capabilities to aid in debugging.
- **ASN Decoding**: Accurately decodes Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from ASMAP files, with built-in error handling and validation checks.
- **Structural Validation**: Ensures the validity and sanity of the ASMAP structure, preventing erroneous behaviors and maintaining data integrity.

## Usage

Add `bitcoin-asmap` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-asmap = "0.1.19"
```

```rust
use bitcoin_asmap::{decode_asmap, interpret};

let asmap_path = "path/to/asmap/file";
let asmap_bits = decode_asmap(asmap_path);
let ip_bits = vec![/* IP bits representation */];

let asn = interpret(&asmap_bits, &ip_bits);
println!("The ASN is: {}", asn);
```
