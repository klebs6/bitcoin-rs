# bitcoinleveldb-crc32

`bitcoinleveldb-crc32` is a Rust crate that enables computation of CRC32C checksums, relevant for error-checking in data storage and transmission. This crate provides efficient functionalities for calculating CRC32C values, masking and unmasking said CRCs, and checking the potential for hardware acceleration of the CRC computation process.

## Features

- **crc32c_value**: Computes the CRC32C checksum for a given data slice, facilitating integrity checks over streams of data.

- **crc32c_mask**: Provides a masked representation of the CRC, helping to prevent accidental CRC collisions in embedded streams.

- **crc32c_unmask**: Unmasks a masked CRC32C, reconstituting the original checksum for verification purposes.

- **crc32c_read_uint32le**: Reads a little-endian 32-bit integer from a buffer, appropriate for handling binary file formats or networking protocols.

- **crc32c_round_up**: Aligns memory addresses to power-of-two boundaries, optimizing data processing performance.

- **crc32c_can_accelerate**: Determines if the CPU supports CRC32C acceleration, potentially increasing the computation speed using specialized processor instructions.

- **crc32c_extend**: Extends an existing CRC32C computation by concatenating new data, preserving the checksum across streaming sequences.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoinleveldb-crc32 = "0.1.19"
```

## Usage

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to use `bitcoinleveldb-crc32`:

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_crc32::crc32c_value;

let data: &[u8] = b"Hello, world!";
let checksum = crc32c_value(data.as_ptr(), data.len());
```
