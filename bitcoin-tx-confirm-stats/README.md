# bitcoin-tx-confirm-stats

## Overview

The `bitcoin-tx-confirm-stats` crate is engineered to provide sophisticated tools for the analysis of Bitcoin transaction confirmation statistics. It features the capacity to deduce transaction feerate information by processing data on transaction inclusion in blocks. The objective is to evaluate and estimate confirmation times based on past transaction behavior.

This crate is particularly useful for scenarios requiring granular analysis of transaction confirmations and optimization of fee strategies using historical data. The application involves creating `TxConfirmStats` objects to track these confirmations, encapsulating feerate values, and measuring transaction confirmation success over specified periods.

## Features

- **Fee Rate Estimation:** Provides mechanisms for calculating fee rate estimates, facilitating the determination of transaction costs required for desired confirmation speeds.
- **Bucket Management:** Implements a system of buckets that categorizes transactions by their feerates and manages the statistics relating to these groups.
- **Advanced Statistical Operations:** Supports complex statistical computations, including median feerate determination, success ratio computations, and decay-based historical averages.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Offers functionality to serialize and deserialize confirmation stats, ensuring resilience and integrity of data across sessions.

## Usage

To make use of this crate, instantiate `TxConfirmStats` and utilize its comprehensive API to manipulate and analyze transaction data. Example tasks include recording new transaction data, updating management statistics, and drawing analytics from the set of confirmed and unconfirmed transactions.

Example instantiation:

```rust
use bitcoin_tx_confirm_stats::TxConfirmStats;
use std::collections::HashMap;

let default_buckets = vec![1.0, 2.0, 4.0];
let default_bucket_map = HashMap::new();
let my_stats = TxConfirmStats::new(&default_buckets, &default_bucket_map, 7, 0.98, 1);
```
