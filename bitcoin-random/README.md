# bitcoin-random

The `bitcoin-random` Rust crate provides a robust and versatile random number generation (RNG) library, with special focus on cryptographic and non-cryptographic applications. It is designed to support a range of RNG capabilities, from basic random number generation to more sophisticated operations that integrate system and hardware entropy efficiently.

## Features

- **Multiple RNG Levels:** Provides three levels of RNG operations (`FAST`, `SLOW`, `PERIODIC`) to suit different needs of entropy and speed.
- **Hardware Support:** Detects and utilizes hardware capabilities like `RdRand` and `RdSeed` when available, efficiently incorporating this entropy into the RNG.
- **Strong Seeding Techniques:** The RNG state maintains a robust 256-bit entropy pool managed through SHA512 operations, ensuring unpredictability over multiple uses.
- **System Entropy Gathering:** Incorporates non-cryptographic environmental data and precise timing from both platform-independent and platform-specific sources.
- **Compatibility:** Conforms to the C++11 `UniformRandomBitGenerator` concept, ensuring interoperability with systems expecting such interfaces.

## Usage

Here's a brief overview of how to use the `bitcoin-random` crate:

```rust
use bitcoin_random::{RNGLevel, get_rand_bytes, get_strong_rand_bytes};

fn main() {
    let mut buf = [0u8; 32];
    // Fast RNG for non-critical randomness
    get_rand_bytes(&mut buf, 32);
    println!("Fast RNG Bytes: {:?}", buf);

    // Strong RNG for cryptographic safety
    get_strong_rand_bytes(&mut buf, 32);
    println!("Strong RNG Bytes: {:?}", buf);
}
```

This example demonstrates fast and strong random byte generation suitable for different security needs.

## Building and Integration

To include `bitcoin-random` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-random = "0.1.21"
```

Ensure that your project runs on the 2021 Rust edition and is compatible with the `lazy_static`, `sha2`, and other dependencies that this crate leverages.
