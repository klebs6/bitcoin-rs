# bitcoinleveldb-env

The `bitcoinleveldb-env` crate provides a Rust implementation of environment management for LevelDB in a cross-platform manner. It offers abstractions to handle file interactions and environment-specific functionalities, translating C++ concepts from the original LevelDB environment utilities.

## Key Features

- **Trait-Based Abstractions**: Offers traits like `Env`, `NewLogger`, `NowMicros`, `SleepForMicroseconds`, and others to implement environment-specific functionalities.
- **File Operations**: Provides utilities to read and write files safely, including synchronous write operations.
- **Environment Wrapper**: The `EnvWrapper` structure allows forwarding calls to another environment, enabling partial overrides of functionality.
- **Thread and Scheduling Capabilities**: Supports thread management and function scheduling within an environment.

## Usage

The primary interface is the `Env` trait, which can be implemented to provide environment-specific operations. The provided default implementation simplifies using standard environment setups, but custom implementations can override specific behaviors as needed.

## Example

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_env::{Env, EnvWrapper};
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

let env = EnvWrapper::new(Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyCustomEnv::new())));
```

## Notes

This crate is part of a series to bridge Rust with existing C++ LevelDB utilities in the Bitcoin system. It aims to be extendable for advanced use-cases.
