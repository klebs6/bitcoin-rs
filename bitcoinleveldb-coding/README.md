# bitcoinleveldb-coding

`bitcoinleveldb-coding` is a Rust crate focused on efficient encoding and decoding routines for fixed-size and variable length integers, as well as slices with length prefixes. It is inspired by low-level data serialization needs prevalent in systems like Google's LevelDB, aiming to provide flexible, low-level access to serialized data directly in memory buffers, typical in storage engines and databases.

## Features

- **Fixed-Length Encoding/Decoding**: Converts 32-bit and 64-bit integers to and from little-endian byte sequences using direct buffer manipulation.
- **Variable-Length Encoding/Decoding**: Supports compact encoding of integers as varints, optimizing for space efficiency especially for small values.
- **Length-Prefixed Slices**: Operations to encode and decode information with a length prefix, enhancing data access in serialized forms.

## Example Usage

```rust
let mut buffer: [u8; 8] = [0; 8];
unsafe {
    encode_fixed32(buffer.as_mut_ptr(), 42);
    let value = decode_fixed32(buffer.as_ptr());
    assert_eq!(value, 42);
}
```

## Safety

This crate extensively uses unsafe Rust to manipulate raw pointers for performance-critical sections that demand fine-grained control of memory operations. User responsibility includes ensuring that provided buffers have adequate size.
