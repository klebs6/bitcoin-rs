# Bitcoin Time

Bitcoin Time is a sophisticated Rust crate designed to handle temporal operations with an emphasis on accuracy and flexibility. Aimed at developers working within cryptocurrency domains or time-sensitive applications, this crate provides utilities for date-time conversions, mock time for testing, and interfaces resembling the C++ `std::chrono` suite.

## Features
- **Time Conversion Utilities**: Convert milliseconds to UNIX time and other formats, useful for interfacing with low-level system operations or C libraries.
- **Chrono Typedefs**: Rust equivalents of the C++ `std::chrono` typedefs, enabling seamless duration handling and conversions.
- **Mock Time Functionality**: Facilitate highly controlled testing environments with mock time features, essential for reliable test cases especially in systems where time-sensitive decisions are critical.
- **ISO-8601 Formatting and Parsing**: Easily convert between Unix timestamps and ISO-8601 formatted strings, ideal for logging, debugging, and off-chain applications.
- **Median Time Filtering**: Implement median filtering over a stream of values for robust and noise-resistant time data analysis.

## Installation
Add `bitcoin-time` to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-time = "0.1.19"
```

## Usage
```rust
use bitcoin_time::MillisToTimeval;

let msec = 1500i64;
let timeval = msec.millis_to_timeval();
println!("Timeval: {} seconds and {} microseconds", timeval.tv_sec, timeval.tv_usec);
```

## Supported Platforms
Bitcoin Time is fully compatible with Rust 2021 edition and requires standard library support, making it ideal for a range of cryptographic, blockchain, and concurrent applications.
