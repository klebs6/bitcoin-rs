# bitcoin-ripemd

`bitcoin-ripemd` is a Rust crate providing an implementation of the RIPEMD-160 hash function, a cryptographic hash function that computes a 160-bit message digest. It is particularly useful in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency, where it is employed by the Bitcoin protocol for address generation.

## Overview
This crate offers a high-performance and efficient implementation of the RIPEMD-160 algorithm, designed with precise computations and safety in mind. The Rust programming language's stringent checks and balances ensure memory safety, thereby reducing vulnerabilities associated with memory management errors often found in lower-level languages.

This implementation supports all necessary operations such as initialization, updating data, and finalizing the hashing process to obtain a secure hash output. Moreover, the module makes extensive use of tracing to enable fine-grained debugging, making it easier to integrate into larger systems.

## Usage
To use `bitcoin-ripemd` in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-ripemd = "0.1.19"
```

### Example
Here's a basic usage example of how you can hash data using this crate:

```rust
use bitcoin_ripemd::Ripemd160;

let data = b"Hello, World!";
let mut hasher = Ripemd160::new();

// Update the hash with the data
hasher.update(data);

// Finalize the hash process and obtain the result
let mut result = [0u8; 20];
hasher.finalize(&mut result);

println!("Hash: {:?}", result);
```

## Functions and Methods
- **Initialization**: Begin a new RIPEMD-160 hash operation.
- **Update**: Continually update the hash with additional bytes of data.
- **Finalize**: Complete the hash operation, returning the resulting 160-bit digest.

This crate's API is straightforward and simple, allowing easy integration and efficient use in cryptographic applications.

## Features and Optimizations
- **Efficient Round Functions**: Implementations of the internal mixing functions that make up the RIPEMD-160 transformation.
- **Low-level Optimizations**: Use of inline functions and manual control over memory layout for maximum performance.
- **Safety and Correctness**: Ensured by Rust's type system and memory guarantees.
