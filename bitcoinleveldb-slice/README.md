# bitcoinleveldb-slice

`bitcoinleveldb-slice` is a Rust library designed to provide a memory-efficient way to reference byte slices from various data sources without copying the data. It primarily aids in accessing portions of data stored externally, ensuring zero-copy operations for performance-critical applications in systems programming, databases, or networking.

## Overview

At its core, the `Slice` struct acts as a smart pointer to byte arrays, which can originate from strings, raw pointers, or fixed-size arrays. The crate contains various implementations and helper functions to manipulate these slices safely and efficiently. It depends heavily on the user guaranteeing the validity of data during the `Slice`'s lifetime.

### Features
- **Zero-Copy Data Access:** Directly work with byte slices, avoiding unnecessary data copying to optimize performance.
- **Indexing and Equality:** Provides indexing capabilities and equality checks, ensuring only valid operations.
- **Conversions:** Convert from Rust's standard collections and C-style strings seamlessly.
- **Memory Management:** Functions to manage and clear slices, ensuring safe and controlled access.

### Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the `Slice` struct:

```rust
let s = String::from("example");
let slice: Slice = Slice::from(&s);
assert_eq!(slice.to_string(), "example");
```

### Safety Considerations
The core of `bitcoinleveldb-slice` involves pointer manipulation and requires careful attention to lifetimes and data validity to avoid undefined behavior.
