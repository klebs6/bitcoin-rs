# bitcoinleveldb-rand

`bitcoinleveldb-rand` is a simple and efficient pseudorandom number generator inspired by the algorithm used in LevelDB. It is tailored to meet the needs of LevelDB and other related packages. The crate is lightweight and designed for scenarios where cryptographic-level randomness isn't necessary but a predictable and consistent random sequence is useful.

## Usage

This crate provides a `Random` struct which can be used to generate random numbers using a seed-based approach. Here are the key functions available:

- `new(s: u32) -> Self`: Constructs a new `Random` instance with a provided seed.
- `next(&mut self) -> u32`: Generates the next pseudorandom number.
- `uniform(&mut self, n: i32) -> u32`: Generates a uniformly distributed value in the range `[0..n-1]`.
- `one_in(&mut self, n: i32) -> bool`: Returns `true` approximately `1/n` of the time, `false` otherwise.
- `skewed(&mut self, max_log: i32) -> u32`: Generates a number biased towards smaller values exponentially up to `2^max_log - 1`.

## Design Details

### Random Number Generation

The algorithm uses a seed and multiplier approach, similar to Park-Miller random number generator, but adapted for 31-bit modulus to ensure a full cycle and avoid degenerate sequences which can lead to non-random behavior.

- **Modulus (`M`)**: `2^31 - 1`
- **Multiplier (`A`)**: Same as used in LevelDB

### Seed Management

By masking the seed with the modulus and ensuring it is never set to `0` or `M`, this crate guarantees the randomness isn't degenerated.
