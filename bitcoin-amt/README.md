# Bitcoin Amount Handling in Rust

## Overview
The `bitcoin-amt` crate provides utilities for managing and working with Bitcoin amounts in satoshis, including differentiation between various ownership states of these amounts. It is designed for use in Bitcoin applications, particularly those involving direct wallet interactions.


## Features

- **Amount Type**: Represents Bitcoin amounts in satoshis, allowing for both positive and negative values.

- **Ownership Filters**: Using the `IsMineFilter` type, users can work with bitflags to categorize Bitcoin's ownership within a wallet, supporting operations like checking if an amount is owned, watch-only, or spendable.

- **CachableAmount Struct**: Facilitates managing amounts subdivided into watch-only and spendable parts, offering caching capabilities and efficient retrieval.

- **Money Range Checking**: Provides functionality to validate that a Bitcoin amount falls within the valid monetary range.

## Getting Started
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-amt = "0.1.19"
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use `CachableAmount`:

```rust
extern crate bitcoin_amt;
use bitcoin_amt::{CachableAmount, Amount, IsMineFilter};

fn main() {
    let mut amount = CachableAmount::new();
    let filter: IsMineFilter = 1; // Watch-only filter
    amount.set(filter, 5000); // 5000 satoshis

    if amount.money_range(&5000) {
        println!("Amount is within valid range.");
    }
}
```
