# bitcoin-crc32c

`bitcoin-crc32c` is a Rust crate designed to efficiently compute the CRC32C checksum, which is commonly used as a data integrity check algorithm in network communication and storage systems. This crate provides an implementation optimized for different CPU architectures, namely x86_64 and AArch64, leveraging specific instruction sets like SSE4.2 and ARMv8's CRC32 extensions.

## Features

- **High Performance**: The library uses platform-specific optimizations to ensure high-speed computation of CRC32C checksums.
- **Cross-Platform**: The crate supports multiple architectures including ARM and x86_64, offering a portable fallback for other platforms.
- **Safety and Flexibility**: While some functions require unsafe operations due to direct memory access, they are wrapped in safe APIs that work transparently with Rust’s type system.

## Usage

Add `bitcoin-crc32c` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-crc32c = "0.1.19"
```

And use it in your project:

```rust
use bitcoin_crc32c::crc32c_with_str;

fn main() {
    let checksum = crc32c_with_str("sample data");
    println!("CRC32C checksum: {:#010x}", checksum);
}
```

## Function Overview

- **crc32c**: Computes the CRC32C checksum for a data buffer.
- **crc32c_with_str**: Safe wrapper to compute the checksum of a string.
- **crc32c_extend**: Extends a CRC with additional data, automatically choosing the best available method based on runtime detection.
