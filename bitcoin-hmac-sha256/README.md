# bitcoin-hmac-sha256

`bitcoin-hmac-sha256` is a Rust crate providing a high-performance library for creating HMACs using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This crate is particularly useful in cryptographic applications where data integrity and authentication are paramount, such as in blockchain and Bitcoin-related implementations.

## Features

- **HMAC-SHA-256 Implementation**: Leverages the SHA-256 algorithm to provide hashed message authentication codes, ensuring data integrity and origin authentication.
- **RFC6979 Compliant**: Implements the deterministic generation of ephemeral keys using HMAC-SHA-256, as specified by RFC6979, often used in digital signatures in cryptocurrencies.
- **Low-level Unsafe Operations**: For high efficiency, this crate employs low-level unsafe operations, allowing for pointer manipulations directly, mirroring performance incentives from C implementations.

## Usage

### Example
Here is an example of how to use the crate to compute an HMAC-SHA-256:

```rust
use bitcoin_hmac_sha256::{HmacSha256, hmac_sha256_initialize, hmac_sha256_write, hmac_sha256_finalize};

// Example key and message
let key = b"supersecretkey";
let message = b"important data";

// Initialize the hasher
let mut hasher: HmacSha256 = HmacSha256::new_with_key(key);

// Write data into the hasher
hasher.write_ref(message);

// Output buffer for the final hash result
let mut output = [0u8; 32];

// Finalize the hash computation
hasher.finalize_into(&mut output);

println!("HMAC-SHA-256: {:?}", output);
```

## Advanced Concepts

This library employs concepts from cryptography, particularly relying on the mathematical robustness of SHA-256, a member of the SHA-2 family. It also implements mechanisms from RFC6979 to ensure that cryptographic signatures remain deterministic, which is crucial for avoiding repeated signatures of the same message in cryptographic applications.
