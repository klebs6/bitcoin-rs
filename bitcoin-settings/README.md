# bitcoin-settings

`bitcoin-settings` provides an advanced configuration management system for the Bitcoin application ecosystem, enabling nuanced handling of configuration from multiple sources such as command-line arguments, read-only configuration files, and read-write settings. It supports the prioritization of configuration data and the integration of various settings sources to manage run-time options effectively.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Configuration Management**: Aggregate settings from various sources with clear precedence.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Supports string, integer, boolean, and null data types with seamless serialization.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains peculiar legacy behaviors essential to Bitcoin operations, such as configuration precedence and negation handling.
- **Efficient Data Access**: Iterators skipping negated values improve performance in data fetching and manipulation.
- **Structured Data Output**: Leverages serialized data outputs for easy debugging and logging.

## Usage

Include the `bitcoin-settings` crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-settings = "0.1.21"
```

Utilize the public methods to read or write configuration settings. The primary entry points are `read_settings` and `write_settings`, facilitating seamless integration of various configuration layers.

```rust
use bitcoin_settings::{read_settings, write_settings};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("settings.json");
    let mut settings = HashMap::new();
    let mut errors = Vec::new();

    if read_settings(&path, &mut settings, &mut errors) {
        println!("Settings read successfully.");
    } else {
        eprintln!("Errors: {:?}", errors);
    }

    if write_settings(&path, &settings, &mut errors) {
        println!("Settings written successfully.");
    } else {
        eprintln!("Errors: {:?}", errors);
    }
}
```
