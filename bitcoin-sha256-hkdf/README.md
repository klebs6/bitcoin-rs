# bitcoin-sha256-hkdf

The `bitcoin-sha256-hkdf` crate provides a high-security key derivation function utilizing the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, in accordance with RFC 5869 standards. Designed specifically for cryptographic purposes, this implementation outputs a fixed key length of 32 bytes (`L=32`) and is optimized for integration within Bitcoin-related security applications and other cryptographic systems requiring robust key management.

## Features

- **Security Compliance**: Adheres to RFC 5869 guidelines for HMAC-based Key Derivation Functions (HKDF).
- **Efficiency**: Efficient key derivation with a fixed output of 32 bytes to meet secure application requirements.
- **Integration Ready**: Perfect for use in sectors such as fintech or blockchain where SHA256-based security is standard.

## Usage

The main struct provided by this crate is `CHKDF_HMAC_SHA256_L32`, which wraps the necessary functionality to create and manage a pseudorandom key based on input parameters.

### Example

```rust
use bitcoin_sha256_hkdf::CHKDF_HMAC_SHA256_L32;

let ikm = b"input keying material";
let salt = String::from("optional salt");

let mut hkdf = CHKDF_HMAC_SHA256_L32::new(ikm.as_ptr(), ikm.len(), &salt);

let info = String::from("info");
let mut derived_key = [0u8; 32];

hkdf.expand32(&info, derived_key);

println!("Derived Key: {:?}", derived_key);
```

## Math & Cryptography Background

The HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function) structure is designed to ensure the security of cryptographic keys by separating inputs and outputs, minimizing their correlation and vulnerability. HMAC-SHA256 ensures both integrity and security by combining SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, with the HMAC construction, providing a barrier against dictionary attacks and ensuring nondeterministic behavior.
