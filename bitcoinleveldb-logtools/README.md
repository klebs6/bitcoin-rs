# bitcoinleveldb-logtools

`bitcoinleveldb-logtools` is an advanced Rust crate providing highly-priced insights and utilities designed for log handling and manipulation in LevelDB implementations, particularly relating to Bitcoin transaction storage. It supplies precise and performant functions to manage log record types and extend these with additional metadata, ensuring robust data integrity even in complex data streaming scenarios.

## Features:
- **Log Record Interface**: Defined enum for managing various stages of log records including Zero, Full, First, Middle, and Last.
- **Logging Traits**: `Logger` and `Logv` traits that establish a foundation for logging functionalities, allowing flexible implementations.
- **Extended Record Types**: By leveraging bitflags, it introduces additional record types for enhanced error handling, such as Eof and BadRecord, addressing cases like invalid CRCs.
- **String Utilities**: Functions such as `number_to_string` and `escape_string` allow conversion and escape sequence handling for log data, enhancing readability and maintenance of string data.
- **Memory Manipulation**: Functions like `append_slice_bytes` and `consume_decimal_number` provide direct memory handling via raw pointers, crucial for high-performance applications.
- **Checksum Initialization**: Utilities for initializing CRC tables, ensuring the validity and reliability of log record types.

The crate is tailored for developers seeking a finely-tuned library that aids in accurate and efficient log data manipulation afforded by Rust's strong type system and safety guarantees.
