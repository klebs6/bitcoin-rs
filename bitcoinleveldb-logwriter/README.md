# bitcoinleveldb-logwriter

`bitcoinleveldb-logwriter` is a Rust crate designed for the efficient logging of records in LevelDB-style storage systems optimized for append operations. This crate provides a mechanism to write both logical and physical records to a backing store, ensuring robust data integrity through comprehensive use of CRC32C checksums.

## Key Features
- **LogWriter struct**: Facilitates the creation and management of logs by fragmenting logical records into physical ones, handling CRC computation, and ensuring data is properly flushed to the storage medium.
- **MockWritableFile Core structs**: Mock implementations of writable files to facilitate testing, which include functions to simulate file operations.
- **CRC32C Checksums**: Integrity of log records is ensured with checksum calculations, preventing data corruption.
- **Efficient Block Management**: Effectively manages log storage by handling block offsets and writing zero-padding when necessary.

## Usage
To utilize the `LogWriter` in your project:
```rust
let mock_file = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MockWritableFileCore::new()));
let log_writer = LogWriter::new(mock_file, 0);

// Adding a record example
let data = b"Your data to log";
let slice = Slice::from(data);
log_writer.add_record(&slice);
```
